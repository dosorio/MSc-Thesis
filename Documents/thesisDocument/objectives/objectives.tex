\chapter*{Objectives}
\section*{Main:}
Identify proteins and metabolic pathways involved in the neuroprotective effects of tibolone in human astrocytes based on metabolic scenarios comparison.
\section*{Specific}
\begin{itemize}
\item Build a tissue-specific computational model of astrocytes metabolism using gene expression data integration.
\item Evaluate the effects caused by the increase of free fatty acids and tibolone presence in astrocytes metabolism.
\item Determine metabolic pathways and relevant functional products in response to steroid tibolone through systems biology approximations.
\item Evaluate the importance of proteins and metabolic pathways previously identified on the dynamics of the metabolic model.
\end{itemize}
