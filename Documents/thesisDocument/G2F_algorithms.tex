\Input{\begin{description}
\item reaction: A stoichiometric reaction with the following format: \texttt{H2O[c] + Urea-1-carboxylate[c] <=>\ 2 CO2[c] + 2 NH3[c]}. Where arrows and plus signs are surrounded by a ``space character''. It is also expected that stoichiometry coefficients are surrounded by spaces. It also expects arrows to be in the form \texttt{=>} or \texttt{<=>}. Meaning that arrows like \texttt{==>}, \texttt{<==>}, \texttt{-->} or \texttt{->} will not be parsed and will lead to errors.
\item reference: A set of stoichiometric reactions with the same format of reaction

\item reactionList: A set of stoichiometric reactions with the following format: \texttt{H2O[c] + Urea-1-carboxylate[c] <=>\ 2 CO2[c] + 2 NH3[c]}. Where arrows and plus signs are surrounded by a ``space character''. It is also expected that stoichiometry coefficients are surrounded by spaces.

\item reference: A set of stoichiometric reaction with the same format of \texttt{reactionList}
\item limit: An addition cost value to be used as a limit to select reactions to be added. Is calculated as $\dfrac{NumberNewMetabolites}{NumerOfMetabolites}$ for each reaction.
\item woCompartment: A boolean value \texttt{TRUE} to define if compartment labels should be removed of the \texttt{reactionList} stoichiometric reactions, \texttt{FALSE} is used as default.
\item consensus: A boolean value \texttt{TRUE} to define if reactionList and newReactions should be reported as a unique vector or \texttt{FALSE} if just newReactions should be reported.
