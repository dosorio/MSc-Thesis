abstract = {For the first time in history, populations in affluent countries may concomitantly indulge in rich food and physical idleness. Various combinations of obesity, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia, with insulin resistance as the common feature, cause hepatic steatosis, which can trigger necroinflammation and fibrosis. Patients with "primary" steatohepatitis exhibit ultrastructural mitochondrial lesions, decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes, and have impaired ability to resynthesize ATP after a fructose challenge. Mitochondria play a major role in fat oxidation and energy production but also leak reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are the main cellular source of ROS. In patients with steatosis, mitochondrial ROS may oxidize hepatic fat deposits, as suggested in animal models. Lipid peroxidation products impair the flow of electrons along the respiratory chain, which may cause overreduction of respiratory chain components, further increasing mitochondrial ROS formation and lipid peroxidation. Another vicious circle could involve ROS-induced depletion of antioxidants, impairing ROS inactivation. Blood vitamin E is decreased in some obese children with steatohepatitis, and serum transaminases improve after vitamin E supplementation. Steatohepatitis is also caused by alcohol abuse, drugs, and other causes. In "secondary" steatohepatitis, mitochondrial ROS formation is further increased as the causative disease itself directly increases ROS or first impairs respiration, which secondarily increases mitochondrial ROS formation. This "second hit" could cause more lipid peroxidation, cytokine induction, Fas ligand induction, and fibrogenesis than in primary steatohepatitis.},

abstract = {Background: Alcohol is a major cause of fatty liver, the disease is a spectrum that is initiated with steatosis, and without therapy it is apt to develop inflammation, necrosis, fibrosis and finally cirrhosis. There are currently no ideal pharmacological reagents that can prevent or reverse this disease. Osthole is an active constituent isolated from the fruit of Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson, a Chinese herbal medicine, which has been used in clinics for many years. It has many functions such as anti-inflammation, anti-osteoporosis and anti-tumor and so on, but there is no report about treatment of alcoholic fatty liver in mice. Aim: To examine the inhibitory effect of osthole on alcohol-induced fatty liver in mice and to investigate the potential mechanisms. Methods: A mouse model with alcoholic fatty liver was induced by orally feeding 52{\%} erguotou wine by gavage when they were simultaneously treated with osthole 10, 20, 40 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Whereafter, the lipids in serum and hepatic tissue, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione hormone (GSH), tumor necrosis factor-?? (TNF-??) in hepatic tissue, hepatic weight coefficient and its histological evaluation were measured. Results: After treatment with osthole, the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), coefficient of hepatic weight, and the hepatic tissue contents of TC and TG were significantly decreased, the levels of MDA and TNF-?? in liver were also decreased, while the GSH in liver was increased. Importantly, the histological evaluation of liver specimens demonstrated that osthole dramatically decreased lipid accumulation. Conclusion: Osthole could inhibit alcohol-induced fatty liver in mice, and the mechanism might be associated with its anti-oxidation and suppression of TNF-?? production. ?? 2008 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.},

abstract = {Humans are evolutionarily adapted to chronic undernutrition as a consequence of ecologically dictated dietary restriction. Increased aridity, cooler temperatures and increased climatic oscillation effected an alteration of the quantity and quality of vegetation upon which hominids depended for food during the Plio-Pleistocene period. Hominids responded physiologically to climate-induced caloric curtailment in the same way organisms respond to experimentally imposed caloric restriction: by reducing the rate and/or altering the manner in which they metabolized fuel. Such metabolic alterations are mediated principally by the hypothalamus and it is herein hypothesized that the human hypothalamus was subjected to substantial selective pressure, promoting an energetically conservative hypometabolic state. Moreover, the most salient phenotypic characteristics typifying the human species - long lifespan, low reproductive potential, lengthy development and high brain/bodyweight ratio - are effectuated in organisms undergoing caloric restriction. These phenotypic/physiological characteristics - herein termed the quadripartite complex - can be modulated by metabolic rate, which is, in turn, modulated by the hypothalamus. An appreciable alteration in climate occurred between 2.0 and 1.5 million years ago, a juncture at which one hominid lineage (Paranthropus) went extinct. Paranthropus was characterized by such external adaptations as robust cranio-facial morphology and pronounced enamel deposition, indicative of subsistence on tough, low-quality vegetal foods. Conversely, the Homo lineage responded to its marginal dietary repertoire through internal means, centering on metabolic suppression. It is herein hypothesized that this adaptive metabolic alteration, enacted in response to ecologically imposed caloric restriction, produced the defining morphologic attributes of Homo and enabled the evolutionary success of the human species. Among the implications of this line of thinking is that modern humans may be particularly sensitive to the deleterious effects of excess energy intake and, concomitantly, particularly amenable to the ameliorative effects of caloric restriction. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Taurine is a semi-essential amino acid and is not incorporated into proteins. In mammalian tissues, taurine is ubiquitous and is the most abundant free amino acid in the heart, retina, skeletal muscle, brain, and leukocytes. In fact, taurine reaches up to 50 mM concentration in leukocytes. Taurine has been shown to be tissue-protective in many models of oxidant-induced injury. One possibility is that taurine reacts with hypochlorous acid, produced by the myeloperoxidase pathway, to produce the more stable but less toxic taurine chloramine (Tau-Cl). However, data from several laboratories demonstrate that Tau-Cl is a powerful regulator of inflammation. Specifically, Tau-Cl has been shown to down-regulate the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in both rodent and human leukocytes. Taurolidine, a derivative of taurine, is commonly used in Europe as an adjunctive therapy for various infections as well as for tumor therapy. Recent molecular studies on the function of taurine provide evidence that taurine is a constituent of biologic macromolecules. Specifically, two novel taurine-containing modified uridines have been found in both human and bovine mitochondria. Studies investigating the mechanism of action of Tau-Cl have shown that it inhibits the activation of NF-??B, a potent signal transducer for inflammatory cytokines, by oxidation of I??B-?? at Met45. Key enzymes for taurine biosynthesis have recently been cloned. Cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme for taurine biosynthesis, has been cloned and sequenced in the mouse, rat and human. Another key enzyme for cysteine metabolism, cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), has also been cloned from rat liver. CDO has a critical role in determining the flux of cysteine between cysteine catabolism/taurine synthesis and glutathione synthesis. Taurine transporter knockout mice show reduced taurine, reduced fertility, and loss of vision due to severe apoptotic retinal degeneration. Apoptosis induced by amino chloramines is a current and important finding since oxidants derived from leukocytes play a key role in killing pathogens. The fundamental importance of taurine in adaptive and acquired immunity will be unveiled using genetic manipulation. ?? 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract = {Activation of astrocytes is a common feature of neurological disorders, but the importance of this phenomenon for neuronal outcome is not fully understood. Treatment of mixed hippocampal cultures of neurones and astrocytes from day 2-4 in vitro (DIV 2-4) with 1 micro m cytosine arabinofuranoside (AraC) caused an activation of astrocytes as detected by a stellate morphology and a 10-fold increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) level compared with vehicle-treated cultures. After DIV 12, we determined 43{\%} and 97{\%} damaged neurones 18 h after the exposure to glutamate (1 mm, 1 h) in cultures treated with vehicle and AraC, respectively. Dose-response curves were different with a higher sensitivity to glutamate in cultures treated with AraC (EC50 = 0.01 mm) than with vehicle (EC50 = 0.12 mm). The susceptibility of neurones to 1 mm glutamate did not correlate with the percentage of astrocytes and was insensitive to an inhibition of glutamate uptake. In cultures treated with vehicle and AraC, glutamate-induced neurotoxicity was mediated through stimulation of the NR1-NR2B subtype of NMDA receptors, because it was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and the NR1-NR2B selective receptor antagonist ifenprodil. Protein levels of the NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptor were similar in cultures treated with vehicle or AraC. AraC-induced changes in glutamate-induced neurotoxicity were mimicked by activation of protein kinase C (PKC), whereas neuronal susceptibility to glutamate was reduced in cultures depleted of PKC and treated with AraC suggesting that the increase in glutamate toxicity by activated astrocytes involves activation of PKC.},

Defined cultures of astrocytes have revealed these cells to be a major source of eicosanoids. In common with other eicosanoid-producing cells, agents such as calcium ionophores and phorbol esters are potent stimuli for promoting release. While in other tissues agonists for receptors linked to calcium mobilisation prompt eicosanoid release, this does not seem to be the case in astrocytes, though a range of such receptors are present. The notable exceptions to this observation are adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate, presumably acting through P2 purinergic receptors. Many cell types in the CNS are targets for eicosanoids, possessing receptors linked to adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C. An appreciation of the functional significance of activation of these receptors is just now beginning. Eicosanoids have effects in the CNS that involve not only the vascular supply but also synaptic modulation and immune regulation.},

abstract = {A number of epidemiologic studies have indicated a strong association between dietary fat intake and prostate cancer development, suggesting that lipid metabolism plays some important roles in prostate carcinogenesis and its progression. In this study, through our genome-wide gene expression analysis of clinical prostate cancer cells, we identified a novel lipogenic gene, ELOVL7, coding a possible long-chain fatty acid elongase, as overexpressed in prostate cancer cells. ELOVL7 expression is regulated by the androgen pathway through SREBP1, as well as other lipogenic enzymes. Knockdown of ELOVL7 resulted in drastic attenuation of prostate cancer cell growth, and it is notable that high-fat diet promoted the growth of in vivo tumors of ELOVL7-expressed prostate cancer. In vitro fatty acid elongation assay and fatty acid composition analysis indicated that ELOVL7 was preferentially involved in fatty acid elongation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (SVLFA, C20:0 approximately ). Lipid profiles showed that knockdown of ELOVL7 in prostate cancer cells affected SVLFAs in the phospholipids and the neutral lipids, such as cholesterol ester. Focusing on cholesterol ester as a source of de novo steroid synthesis, we show that ELOVL7 affected de novo androgen synthesis in prostate cancer cells. These findings suggest that EVOLV7 could be involved in prostate cancer growth and survival through the metabolism of SVLFAs and their derivatives, could be a key molecule to elucidate the association between fat dietary intake and prostate carcinogenesis, and could also be a promising molecular target for development of new therapeutic or preventive strategies for prostate cancers.},

So far, no clear picture has emerged as to whether a protein channel is capable of transporting exclusively neutral NH(3) while excluding H(+) and NH(4)(+). Our research is the first stoichiometric study to show the selective transport of NH(3) by a membrane channel. The purified water channel protein aquaporin-8 was reconstituted into planar bilayers, and the exclusion of NH(4)(+) or H(+) was established by ensuring a lack of current under voltage clamp conditions. The single channel water permeability coefficient of 1.2 x 10(-14) cm(3)/subunit/s was established by imposing an osmotic gradient across reconstituted planar bilayers, and resulting minute changes in ionic concentration close to the membrane surface were detected. It is more than 2-fold smaller than the single channel ammonia permeability (2.7 x 10(-14) cm(3)/subunit/s) that was derived by establishing a transmembrane ammonium concentration gradient and measuring the resulting concentration increases adjacent to the membrane. This permeability ratio suggests that electrically silent ammonia transport may be the main function of AQP8.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Different mouse models of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) demonstrate various aspects of the pathophysiology of IBD. We looked for overlapping gene expression profiles in three different mouse models of experimental colitis and analysed whether these overlapping genes are of help to find new genes that could be used as general markers in human IBD. METHODS: Using Agilent mouse TOX oligonucleotide microarrays, we analysed the gene expression profiles in three widely used models of experimental colitis: 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid, dextran sodium sulfate and CD4CD45RB transfer and looked for overlapping gene expression in these models. Overlapping genes were analysed using Lightcycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in biopsy materials from human IBD and control tissue. RESULTS: Compared with control mice in dextran sodium sulfate, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid and the CD45RB transfer colitis mice five known genes, extracellular proteinase inhibitor (Expi), glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2), mast cell protease 1 (Mcpt1), resistin-like beta (Retnlb) and sulphatase 2 (Sulf2), and two unknown genes were upregulated and the two genes aquaporin 8 (Aqp8) and kallikrein 5 (Klk5) were downregulated in all three models. In human Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis biopsies, one of the upregulated glutathione peroxidase (Gpx2) and one of the downregulated Aqp8 genes in the mouse models were also differentially expressed in affected colonic tissue of patients with IBD. CONCLUSION: Experimental mouse models are suitable models for the search of new markers for human IBD. As both Gpx2 and Aqp8 are involved in H2O2 metabolism (Gpx2 as a radical scavenger whereas Aqp8 facilitates its diffusion), upregulation of Gpx2 and downregulation of Aqp8 could be a mechanism to defend against severe oxidative stress and indicate that H2O2 is a universal mediator in the inflammatory process in the colon. This provides a focus on homeostasis of the antioxidant pathway and its importance in IBD.},

abstract = {Beyond their contribution to basic metabolism, the major cellular organelles, in particular mitochondria, can determine whether cells respond to stress in an adaptive or suicidal manner. Thus, mitochondria can continuously adapt their shape to changing bioenergetic demands as they are subjected to quality control by autophagy, or they can undergo a lethal permeabilization process that initiates apoptosis. Along similar lines, multiple proteins involved in metabolic circuitries, including oxidative phosphorylation and transport of metabolites across membranes, may participate in the regulated or catastrophic dismantling of organelles. Many factors that were initially characterized as cell death regulators are now known to physically or functionally interact with metabolic enzymes. Thus, several metabolic cues regulate the propensity of cells to activate self-destructive programs, in part by acting on nutrient sensors. This suggests the existence of "metabolic checkpoints" that dictate cell fate in response to metabolic fluctuations. Here, we discuss recent insights into the intersection between metabolism and cell death regulation that have major implications for the comprehension and manipulation of unwarranted cell loss.},

abstract = {Skeletal myocytes are metabolically active and susceptible to insulin resistance and are thus implicated in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This complex disease involves systemic metabolic changes, and their elucidation at the systems level requires genome-wide data and biological networks. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a network context for the integration of high-throughput data. We generated myocyte-specific RNA-sequencing data and investigated their correlation with proteome data. These data were then used to reconstruct a comprehensive myocyte GEM. Next, we performed a meta-analysis of six studies comparing muscle transcription in T2D versus healthy subjects. Transcriptional changes were mapped on the myocyte GEM, revealing extensive transcriptional regulation in T2D, particularly around pyruvate oxidation, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and tetrahydrofolate metabolism, connected through the downregulated dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. Strikingly, the gene signature underlying this metabolic regulation successfully classifies the disease state of individual samples, suggesting that regulation of these pathways is a ubiquitous feature of myocytes in response to T2D.},

abstract = {Fatty liver is an early stage of alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease (ALD and NALD) that progresses to steatohepatitis and other irreversible conditions. In this study, we identified proteins that were differentially expressed in the livers of rats fed 5{\%} ethanol in a Lieber-DeCarli diet daily for 1 and 3. months by discovery proteomics (two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry) and non-parametric modeling (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines). Hepatic fatty infiltration was significantly higher in ethanol-fed animals as compared to controls, and more pronounced at 3. months of ethanol feeding. Discovery proteomics identified changes in the expression of proteins involved in alcohol, lipid, and amino acid metabolism after ethanol feeding. At 1 and 3. months, 12 and 15 different proteins were differentially expressed. Of the identified proteins, down regulation of alcohol dehydrogenase (- 1.6) at 1. month and up regulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (2.1) at 3. months could be a protective/adaptive mechanism against ethanol toxicity. In addition, betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 2 a protein responsible for methionine metabolism and previously implicated in fatty liver development was significantly up regulated (1.4) at ethanol-induced fatty liver stage (1. month) while peroxiredoxin-1 was down regulated (-1.5) at late fatty liver stage (3. months). Nonparametric analysis of the protein spots yielded fewer proteins and narrowed the list of possible markers and identified d-dopachrome tautomerase (-1.7, at 3. months) as a possible marker for ethanol-induced early steatohepatitis. The observed differential regulation of proteins have potential to serve as biomarker signature for the detection of steatosis and its progression to steatohepatitis once validated in plasma/serum. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for its transport across cell membranes remain poorly understood, classical amino acid transport system N appears particularly important. Using intracellular pH measurements, we have now identified an orphan protein related to a vesicular neurotransmitter transporter as system N. Functional analysis shows that this protein (SN1) involves H+ exchange as well as Na+ cotransport and, under physiological conditions, mediates glutamine efflux as well as uptake. Together with the pattern of SN1 expression, these unusual properties suggest novel physiological roles for system N in nitrogen metabolism and synaptic transmission.},

abstract = {We studied GABAergic signaling in astrocytes of olfactory bulb slices using confocal Ca(2+) imaging and two-photon Na(+) imaging. GABA evoked Ca(2+) transients in astrocytes that persisted in the presence of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor antagonists, but were suppressed by inhibition of GABA uptake by SNAP 5114. Withdrawal of external Ca(2+) blocked GABA-induced Ca(2+) transients, and depletion of Ca(2+) stores with cyclopiazonic acid reduced Ca(2+) transients by approximately 90{\%}. This indicates that the Ca(2+) transients depend on external Ca(2+), but are mainly mediated by intracellular Ca(2+) release, conforming with Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release. Inhibition of ryanodine receptors did not affect GABA-induced Ca(2+) transients, whereas the InsP(3) receptor blocker 2-APB inhibited the Ca(2+) transients. GABA also induced Na(+) increases in astrocytes, potentially reducing Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. To test whether reduction of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange induces Ca(2+) signaling, we inhibited Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange with KB-R7943, which mimicked GABA-induced Ca(2+) transients. Endogenous GABA release from neurons, activated by stimulation of afferent axons or NMDA application, also triggered Ca(2+) transients in astrocytes. The significance of GABAergic Ca(2+) signaling in astrocytes for control of blood flow is demonstrated by SNAP 5114-sensitive constriction of blood vessels accompanying GABA uptake. The results suggest that GABAergic signaling is composed of GABA uptake-mediated Na(+) rises that reduce Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, thereby leading to a Ca(2+) increase sufficient to trigger Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release via InsP(3) receptors. Hence, GABA transporters not only remove GABA from the extracellular space, but may also contribute to intracellular signaling and astrocyte function, such as control of blood flow.},

abstract = {Astrocytes can release glutamate in a calcium-dependent manner and consequently signal to adjacent neurons. Whether this glutamate release pathway is used during physiological signaling or is recruited only under pathophysiological conditions is not well defined. One reason for this lack of understanding is the limited knowledge about the levels of calcium necessary to stimulate glutamate release from astrocytes and about how they compare with the range of physiological calcium levels in these cells. We used flash photolysis to raise internal calcium in astrocytes, while monitoring astrocytic calcium levels and glutamate, which evoked slow inward currents that were recorded electrophysiologically from single neurons grown on microislands of astrocytes. With this approach, we demonstrate that modest changes of astrocytic calcium, from 84 to 140 nM, evoke substantial glutamatergic currents in neighboring neurons (-391 pA), with a Hill coefficient of 2.1 to 2.7. Because the agonists glutamate, norepinephrine, and dopamine all raise calcium in astrocytes to levels exceeding 1.8 microM, these quantitative studies demonstrate that the astrocytic glutamate release pathway is engaged at physiological levels of internal calcium. Consequently, the calcium-dependent release of glutamate from astrocytes functions within an appropriate range of astrocytic calcium levels to be used as a signaling pathway within the functional nervous system},

We found that histidine, one of the conditionally essential amino acids, significantly inhibited both hydrogen peroxide- and TNF-??-induced IL-8 secretion and mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells and HT-29 cells. These inhibitions were dose dependent and the inhibition rate of hydrogen peroxide-induced IL-8 secretion reached more than 50{\%} at a concentration of 25 mM, with over 95{\%} inhibition at a concentration of 50 mM. TNF-?? increased the transcriptional activity of the IL-8 promoter which was significantly inhibited by treating Caco-2 cells with histidine. Histidine also abolished the NF-??B-dependent activation of the IL-8 promoter induced by TNF-??. These results indicate that histidine inhibited the hydrogen peroxide- and TNF-??-induced IL-8 secretion at the transcriptional level in intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that histidine has the potential to attenuate intestinal inflammation. ?? 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

abstract = {In order for the brain to use the common amino acid glutamate as a neurotransmitter, it has been necessary to introduce a series of innovations that greatly restrict the availability of glutamate, so that it cannot degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of glutamatergic neurons. The most far-reaching innovations have been: i) to exclude the brain from access to glutamate in the systemic circulation by the blood-brain barrier, thereby making the brain autonomous in the production and disposal of glutamate; ii) to surround glutamatergic synapses with glial cells and endow these cells with much more powerful glutamate uptake carriers than the neurons themselves, so that most released transmitter glutamate is rapidly inactivated by uptake in glial cells; iii) to restrict to glial cells a key enzyme (glutamine synthetase) that is involved in the return of accumulated glutamate to neurons by amidation to glutamine, which has no transmitter activity, and can be safely released to the extracellular space, returned to neurons and deaminated to glutamate; iv) to restrict to glial cells two key enzymes (pyruvate carboxylase and cytosolic malic enzyme) that are involved in, respectively, de novo synthesis (from glucose) of the carbon skeleton of glutamate, and the return of the carbon skeleton of excess glutamate to the metabolic pathway for glucose oxidation. As a consequence of these innovations, neurons constantly require new carbon skeletons from glial to sustain their TCA cycle. When these supplies are withdrawn, neurons are unable to generate amino acid transmitters and their rate of oxidative metabolism is impaired. Given the commensalism that exists between neurons and glia, it may be fruitful to view brain function not just as a series of interactions between neurons, but also as a series of interactions between neurons and their collaborating glial cells.},

The mechanisms of abnormal iron deposition in MS are not fully understood, nor do we know whether these deposits have adverse consequences, that is, contribute to pathogenesis. With some exceptions, excess levels of iron are represented concomitantly in multiple deep gray matter structures often with bilateral representation, whereas in white matter, pathological iron deposits are usually located at sites of inflammation that are associated with veins. These distinct spatial patterns suggest disparate mechanisms of iron accumulation between these regions. Iron has been postulated to promote disease activity in MS by various means: (i) iron can amplify the activated state of microglia resulting in the increased production of proinflammatory mediators; (ii) excess intracellular iron deposits could promote mitochondria dysfunction; and (iii) improperly managed iron could catalyze the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). The pathological consequences of abnormal iron deposits may be dependent on the affected brain region and/or accumulation process. Here, we review putative mechanisms of enhanced iron uptake in MS and address the likely roles of iron in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

abstract = {Astrocytes play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we showed that saturated free fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA), upregulates $\beta$-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) level and amyloidogenesis in primary rat neurons mediated by astrocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which conditioned media from PA-treated astrocytes upregulates BACE1 level in neurons are unknown. This study demonstrates that serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) in the astrocytes increases ceramide levels, which enhances the release of cytokines that mediate the activation of neural and acidic sphingomyelinase (SMase) in the neurons, to propagate the deleterious effects of PA (i.e., BACE1 upregulation). In support of the relevance of SPT in AD, our laboratory recently measured and found SPT levels to be significantly upregulated in AD brains as compared with controls. Cytokines, namely tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ and interleukin-1$\beta$, released into the conditioned media of PA-treated astrocytes activate neural and acidic SMase in the neurons. Neutralizing the cytokines in the PA-treated astrocyte conditioned media reduced BACE1 upregulation. However, inhibiting SPT in the astrocytes decreased the levels of both tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ and interleukin-1$\beta$ in the conditioned media, which in turn reduced the SMase activities and BACE1 level in primary neurons. Thus, our results suggest that the activation of the astrocytes by PA is mediated by SPT, and the activated astrocytes increases BACE1 level in the neurons; the latter is mediate by the SMases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Astrocytes are involved in multiple brain functions in physiological conditions, participating in neuronal development, synaptic activity and homeostatic control of the extracellular environment. They also actively participate in the processes triggered by brain injuries, aimed at limiting and repairing brain damages. Purines may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of numerous acute and chronic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes are the main source of cerebral purines. They release either adenine-based purines, e.g. adenosine and adenosine triphosphate, or guanine-based purines, e.g. guanosine and guanosine triphosphate, in physiological conditions and release even more of these purines in pathological conditions. Astrocytes express several receptor subtypes of P1 and P2 types for adenine-based purines. Receptors for guanine-based purines are being characterised. Specific ecto-enzymes such as nucleotidases, adenosine deaminase and, likely, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, metabolise both adenine- and guanine-based purines after release from astrocytes. This regulates the effects of nucleotides and nucleosides by reducing their interaction with specific membrane binding sites. Adenine-based nucleotides stimulate astrocyte proliferation by a P2-mediated increase in intracellular [Ca2+] and isoprenylated proteins. Adenosine also, via A2 receptors, may stimulate astrocyte proliferation, but mostly, via A1 and/or A3 receptors, inhibits astrocyte proliferation, thus controlling the excessive reactive astrogliosis triggered by P2 receptors. The activation of A1 receptors also stimulates astrocytes to produce trophic factors, such as nerve growth factor, S100?? protein and transforming growth factor ??, which contribute to protect neurons against injuries. Guanosine stimulates the output of adenine-based purines from astrocytes and in addition it directly triggers these cells to proliferate and to produce large amount of neuroprotective factors. These data indicate that adenine- and guanine-based purines released in large amounts from injured or dying cells of CNS may act as signals to initiate brain repair mechanisms widely involving astrocytes. ?? 2001 ISDN.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human glioblastoma is a deadly brain cancer that continues to defy all current therapeutic strategies. The authors induced apoptosis in human glioblastoma T98G and U87MG cells after treatment with apigenin, (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and genistein, which did not induce apoptosis in human normal astrocytes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Induction of apoptosis was examined using Wright staining and ApopTag assay. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase in intracellular free Ca(2+) were measured by fluorescent probes. Analysis of mRNA and Western blotting indicated increases in expression and activities of the stress kinases and cysteine proteases for apoptosis. JC-1 showed changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), and use of specific inhibitors confirmed activation of kinases and proteases in apoptosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Treatment of glioblastoma cells with apigenin, (-)-epigallocatechin, EGCG, or genistein triggered ROS production that induced apoptosis with phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and activation of the redox-sensitive c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 pathway. Pretreatment of cells with ascorbic acid attenuated ROS production and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Increases in intracellular free Ca2+ and activation of caspase-4 indicated involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress in apoptosis. Other events in apoptosis included overexpression of Bax, loss of DeltaPsi(m), mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac into the cytosol, down-regulation of baculoviral inhibitor-of-apoptosis repeat-containing proteins, and activation of calpain, caspase-9, and caspase-3. (-)-Epigallocatechin and EGCG also induced caspase-8 activity. Apigenin, (-)-epigallocatechin, EGCG, and genistein did not induce apoptosis in human normal astrocytes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Results strongly suggest that flavonoids are potential therapeutic agents for induction of apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells.},

abstract = {Astrocytic energy demand is stimulated by K(+) and glutamate uptake, signaling processes, responses to neurotransmitters, Ca(2+) fluxes, and filopodial motility. Astrocytes derive energy from glycolytic and oxidative pathways, but respiration, with its high-energy yield, provides most adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP). The proportion of cortical oxidative metabolism attributed to astrocytes ( approximately 30{\%}) in in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic and autoradiographic studies corresponds to their volume fraction, indicating similar oxidation rates in astrocytes and neurons. Astrocyte-selective expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) enables synthesis of glutamate from glucose, accounting for two-thirds of astrocytic glucose degradation via combined pyruvate carboxylation and dehydrogenation. Together, glutamate synthesis and oxidation, including neurotransmitter turnover, generate almost as much energy as direct glucose oxidation. Glycolysis and glycogenolysis are essential for astrocytic responses to increasing energy demand because astrocytic filopodial and lamellipodial extensions, which account for 80{\%} of their surface area, are too narrow to accommodate mitochondria; these processes depend on glycolysis, glycogenolysis, and probably diffusion of ATP and phosphocreatine formed via mitochondrial metabolism to satisfy their energy demands. High glycogen turnover in astrocytic processes may stimulate glucose demand and lactate production because less ATP is generated when glucose is metabolized via glycogen, thereby contributing to the decreased oxygen to glucose utilization ratio during brain activation. Generated lactate can spread from activated astrocytes via low-affinity monocarboxylate transporters and gap junctions, but its subsequent fate is unknown. Astrocytic metabolic compartmentation arises from their complex ultrastructure; astrocytes have high oxidative rates plus dependence on glycolysis and glycogenolysis, and their energetics is underestimated if based solely on glutamate cycling.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular and immune system abnormalities have been reported in females with estrogen deficiency. To control these disorders in post-menopausal women, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been used. Tibolone has been used as a HRT, but the effects of tibolone on the natriuretic peptide system have not been determined. We investigated the effects of tibolone on the natriuretic peptide system and pro-inflammatory cytokines in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Female rats were divided into four groups: SHAM, OVX, OVX treated with 17$\beta$-estradiol (OVX+E: 14. days) and OVX treated with tibolone (OVX+T: 14. days) beginning 21. days after ovariectomy. On day 35, blood was collected to determine atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) levels. In addition, tissues were collected for determining ANP, natriuretic peptide receptor type-A (NPR-A), and NPR type-C (NPR-C) gene expression levels by RT-PCR. The cytokine levels of both IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$ were increased in OVX animals. In comparison, IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$ levels were reduced in OVX+E animals. TNF-$\alpha$ levels were reduced similarly in OVX+T animals, but IL-6 levels remained elevated in this group. The concentrations of ANP in the left atrium tissue and plasma were decreased after ovariectomy, as were ANP mRNA levels in the left atrium and NPR-A mRNA levels in kidney. No variation in NPR-C gene expression in the kidney tissue was observed among the groups. Tibolone and 17$\beta$-estradiol effectively increased plasma ANP and ANP mRNA levels in the left atrium, but did not normalize renal NPR-A levels. Since HRT with tibolone normalizes plasma ANP and serum TNF-alpha levels our results suggest that treatment with tibolone has anti-inflammatory effects and could prevent cardiovascular disease in the long-term. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cysteine is the rate-limiting precursor of glutathione synthesis. Evidence suggests that astrocytes can provide cysteine and/or glutathione to neurons. However, it is still unclear how cysteine is released and what the mechanisms of cysteine maintenance by astrocytes entail. In this report, we analyzed cysteine, glutathione, and related compounds in astrocyte conditioned medium using HPLC methods. In addition to cysteine and glutathione, cysteine-glutathione disulfide was found in the conditioned medium. In cystine-free conditioned medium, however, only glutathione was detected. These results suggest that glutathione is released by astrocytes directly and that cysteine is generated from the extracellular thiol/disulfide exchange reaction of cystine and glutathione: glutathione + cystine{\textless}--{\textgreater}cysteine + cysteine-glutathione disulfide. Conditioned medium from neuron-enriched cultures was also assayed in the same way as astrocyte conditioned medium, and no cysteine or glutathione was detected. This shows that neurons cannot themselves provide thiols but instead rely on astrocytes. We analyzed cysteine and related compounds in rat CSF and in plasma of the carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Our results indicate that cystine is transported from blood to the CNS and that the thiol/disulfide exchange reaction occurs in the brain in vivo. Cysteine and glutathione are unstable and oxidized to their disulfide forms under aerobic conditions. Therefore, constant release of glutathione by astrocytes is essential to maintain stable levels of thiols in the CNS.},

Furthermore, impairments in astrocytic function are increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to neuronal dysfunction and, in particular, neurodegenerative processes. In this review, we discuss recent evidence supporting important roles for astrocytes in neuropathological conditions such as neuroinflammation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.

abstract = {Hypoglycemia occurs frequently during intensive insulin therapy in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and remains the single most important obstacle in achieving tight glycemic control. Using a rodent model of hypoglycemia, we demonstrated that exposure to antecedent recurrent hypoglycemia leads to adaptations of brain metabolism so that modest increments in circulating lactate allow the brain to function normally under acute hypoglycemic conditions. We characterized 3 major factors underlying this effect. First, we measured enhanced transport of lactate both into as well as out of the brain that resulted in only a small increase of its contribution to total brain oxidative capacity, suggesting that it was not the major fuel. Second, we observed a doubling of the glucose contribution to brain metabolism under hypoglycemic conditions that restored metabolic activity to levels otherwise only observed at euglycemia. Third, we determined that elevated lactate is critical for maintaining glucose metabolism under hypoglycemia, which preserves neuronal function. These unexpected findings suggest that while lactate uptake was enhanced, it is insufficient to support metabolism as an alternate substrate to replace glucose. Lactate is, however, able to modulate metabolic and neuronal activity, serving as a "metabolic regulator" instead.},

abstract = {Network-oriented analysis is essential to identify those parts of a cell affected by a given perturbation. The effect of neurodegenerative perturbations in the form of diseases of brain metabolism was investigated by using a newly reconstructed brain-specific metabolic network. The developed stoichiometric model correctly represents healthy brain metabolism, and includes 630 metabolic reactions in and between astrocytes and neurons, which are controlled by 570 genes. The integration of transcriptome data of six neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia) with the model was performed to identify reporter features specific and common for these diseases, which revealed metabolites and pathways around which the most significant changes occur. The identified metabolites are potential biomarkers for the pathology of the related diseases. Our model indicated perturbations in oxidative stress, energy metabolism including TCA cycle and lipid metabolism as well as several amino acid related pathways, in agreement with the role of these pathways in the studied diseases. The computational prediction of transcription factors that commonly regulate the reporter metabolites was achieved through binding-site analysis. Literature support for the identified transcription factors such as USF1, SP1 and those from FOX families are known from the literature to have regulatory roles in the identified reporter metabolic pathways as well as in the neurodegenerative diseases. In essence, the reconstructed brain model enables the elucidation of effects of a perturbation on brain metabolism and the illumination of possible machineries in which a specific metabolite or pathway acts as a regulatory spot for cellular reorganization. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

The objectives of this study were to search for alternative toxicity biomarkers which could be detected with high sensitivity prior to the appearance of morphological changes or alterations of analytical conventional biomarkers. The related proteins in the process of cell degeneration/necrosis such as cell death, lipid metabolism and lipid/carbohydrate metabolism were mainly affected under exposure to APAP, AD and TC, respectively. Among the differentially expressed proteins, several oxidative stress-related proteins were clearly identified after 24-hr exposure, even though they were not affected for 6-hr exposure. They were glutathione peroxidase (GPX) as a down-regulated protein as well as peroxiredoxin 1 (PRX1) and peroxiredoxin 2 (PRX2) as up-regulated proteins, which are known to serve as antioxidative enzymes in cells. These findings suggested that the focused proteins, GPX and PRXs, could be utilized as biomarkers of hepatotoxicity, and they were useful for setting high throughput screening methods to assess hepatotoxicity in the early stage of drug discovery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In the light of recent advances in tumor biology and genetics, we hypothesized that tibolone, an estrogen receptor agonist, may have antiproliferative effects on primary human glioblastoma cells and rat C6 malignant glioma cell lines. We thought that tibolone should exert its antiproliferative effects by augmenting glial cell differentiation through the naive, nonhypermethylated estrogen receptors in the glioma cells. METHODS: Human primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells were acquired perioperatively from ten patients aged between 45 and 69 years, diagnosed clinically and radiologically with GBM. The diagnosis was confirmed using immunohistochemical assays. Human GBM and rat C6 malignant glioma cells were cultivated in vitro to obtain monolayer cell cultures. Tibolone was then applied to these cultures in wells, each containing 500,000 tumor cells. RESULTS: Tibolone significantly decreased the number of human GBM cells at the concentrations of 10 and 100 mg/ml. For tibolone, a strong dose-dependent correlation in tumor inhibition was found (p=0.001). This antiproliferative effect of tibolone in human GBM cells was not observed in rat C6 malignant glioma cells. Tibolone demonstrated differential effects on human GBM and rat C6 glioma cells. DISCUSSION: In vitro antiproliferative effects of tibolone on human GBM need to be investigated further in in vivo works.},

abstract = {Spinal cord and brain injuries lead to complex cellular and molecular interactions within the central nervous system in an attempt to repair the initial tissue damage. Many studies have illustrated the importance of the glial cell response to injury, and the influences of inflammation and wound healing processes on the overall morbidity and permanent disability that result. The abortive attempts of neuronal regeneration after spinal cord injury are influenced by inflammatory cell activation, reactive astrogliosis and the production of both growth promoting and inhibitory extracellular molecules. Despite the historical perspective that the glial scar was a mechanical barrier to regeneration, inhibitory molecules in the forming scar and methods to overcome them have suggested molecular modification strategies to allow neuronal growth and functional regeneration. Unlike myelin associated inhibitory molecules, which remain at largely static levels before and after central nervous system trauma, inhibitory extracellular matrix molecules are dramatically upregulated during the inflammatory stages after injury providing a window of opportunity for the delivery of candidate therapeutic interventions. While high dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy alone has not proved to be the solution to this difficult clinical problem, other strategies for modulating inflammation and changing the make up of inhibitory molecules in the extracellular matrix are providing robust evidence that rehabilitation after spinal cord and brain injury has the potential to significantly change the outcome for what was once thought to be permanent disability. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Our comprehensive evaluation of the litera- ture revealed many gaps in the current understanding of human metabolism that require future experimental investigation. Math- ematical analysis of network structure elucidated the implications of intracellular compartmentalization and the potential use of correlated reaction sets for alternative drug target identification. Integrated analysis of high-throughput data sets within the con- text of the reconstruction enabled a global assessment of func- tional metabolic states.

abstract = {The cellular responses to spinal cord or brain injury include the production of molecules that modulate wound healing. This study examined the upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, a family of molecules present in the wound healing matrix that may inhibit axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) after trauma. We have demonstrated increases in these putative inhibitory molecules in brain and spinal cord injury models, and we observed a close correlation between the tissue distribution of their upregulation and the presence of inflammation and a compromised blood-brain barrier. We determined that the presence of degenerating and dying axons injured by direct trauma does not provide a sufficient signal to induce the increases in proteoglycans observed after injury. Activated macrophages, their products, or other serum components that cross a compromised blood-brain barrier may provide a stimulus for changes in extracellular matrix molecules after CNS injury. While gliosis is associated with increased levels of proteoglycans, not all reactive astrocytes are associated with augmented amounts of these extracellular matrix molecules, which suggests a heterogeneity among glial cells that exhibit a reactive phenotype. Chondroitin sulfate also demarcates developing cavities of secondary necrosis, implicating these types of boundary molecules in the protective response of the CNS to trauma.},

The major tibolone metabolites, the two hydroxymetabolites, bind and activate ER with a preference for ER$\alpha$. Tibolone and the $\Delta$4-tibolone are agonists for AR and PR and surprisingly 3$\alpha$- and 3$\beta$-OH-tibolone are antagonists for them. Moreover we showed for the first time that tibolone and its primary metabolites are GR and MR antagonists with a stronger affinity for MR than for GR.

abstract = {Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a group of lysosomal storage diseases (LSD), characterized by the deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). This deficiency leads to the lysosomal accumulation of partially degraded GAG. Nevertheless, deficiency of a single lysosomal enzyme has been associated with impairment in other cell mechanism, such as apoptosis and redox balance. Although GAG analysis represents the main biomarker for MPS diagnosis, it has several limitations that can lead to a misdiagnosis, whereby the identification of new biomarkers represents an important issue for MPS. In this study, we used a system biology approach, through the use of a genome-scale human metabolic reconstruction to understand the effect of metabolism alterations in cell homeostasis and to identify potential new biomarkers in MPS. In-silico MPS models were generated by silencing of MPS-related enzymes, and were analyzed through a flux balance and variability analysis. We found that MPS models used approximately 2286 reactions to satisfy the objective function. Impaired reactions were mainly involved in cellular respiration, mitochondrial process, amino acid and lipid metabolism, and ion exchange. Metabolic changes were similar for MPS I and II, and MPS III A to C; while the remaining MPS showed unique metabolic profiles. Eight and thirteen potential high-confidence biomarkers were identified for MPS IVB and VII, respectively, which were associated with the secondary pathologic process of LSD. In vivo evaluation of predicted intermediate confidence biomarkers (??-hexosaminidase and ??-glucoronidase) for MPS IVA and VI correlated with the in-silico prediction. These results show the potential of a computational human metabolic reconstruction to understand the molecular mechanisms this group of diseases, which can be used to identify new biomarkers for MPS.},

abstract = {Muscat R and Valentino M (2015) The central role of aquaporins in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. Stroke is a complex and devastating neurological condition with limited treatment options. Brain edema is a serious complication of stroke. Early edema formation can significantly contribute to infarct formation and thus represents a promising target. Aquaporin (AQP) water channels contribute to water homeostasis by regulating water transport and are implicated in several disease pathways. At least 7 AQP subtypes have been identified in the rodent brain and the use of transgenic mice has greatly aided our understanding of their functions. AQP4, the most abundant channel in the brain, is up-regulated around the peri-infarct border in transient cerebral ischemia and AQP4 knockout mice demonstrate significantly reduced cerebral edema and improved neurological outcome. In models of vasogenic edema, brain swelling is more pronounced in AQP4-null mice than wild-type providing strong evidence of the dual role of AQP4 in the formation and resolution of both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema. AQP4 is co-localized with inwardly rectifying K + -channels (K ir 4.1) and glial K + uptake is attenuated in AQP4 knockout mice compared to wild-type, indicating some form of functional interaction. AQP4-null mice also exhibit a reduction in calcium signaling, suggesting that this channel may also be involved in triggering pathological downstream signaling events. Associations with the gap junction protein Cx43 possibly recapitulate its role in edema dissipation within the astroglial syncytium. Other roles ascribed to AQP4 include facilitation of astrocyte migration, glial scar formation, modulation of inflammation and signaling functions. Treatment of ischemic cerebral edema is based on the various mechanisms in which fluid content in different brain compartments can be modified. The identification of modulators and inhibitors of AQP4 offer new therapeutic avenues in the hope of reducing the extent of morbidity and mortality in stroke.},

abstract = {AIMS: Tibolone is a tissue-specific compound with favourable effects on bone, vagina, climacteric symptoms, mood and sexual well being in postmenopausal women, without stimulating the endometrium or breast. Since tibolone is used for the treatment of both young and elderly postmenopausal women, its pharmacokinetics were studied to investigate potential differences with age. In addition, the bioequivalence of the 1.25 and 2.5 mg tablets was evaluated. METHODS: Single doses of 1.25 or 2.5 mg of tibolone were given in a double-blind, randomized, two-way cross-over study to women aged between 45 and 55 years or between 65 and 75 years of age. RESULTS: Age did not have a significant effect on C(max), t(max), and t(1/2) of tibolone and its metabolites and on the body weight standardized oral clearance (CL/F kg(-1)) of the 3alpha- and 3beta-hydroxy tibolones. In early postmenopausal women, significantly lower values were found for the AUC(0,16 h), and AUC(0, infinity ) of 3alpha-hydroxy tibolone 24.6+/-6.6 vs 29.2+/-4.9 and 27.1+/-6.9 vs 32.3+/-6.5 ng ml(-1) h for the 1.25 mg tablet, respectively, and 45.4+/-13.9 vs 55.7+/-14.1 and 49.6+/-14.6 vs 62.6+/-17.3 ng ml-1 h for the 2.5 mg tablet, respectively. When these values were adjusted for the significantly higher body weight of the early postmenopausal women, the differences disappeared. No significant differences between early and late postmenopausal women were found for the AUC(0,8 h), and AUC(0, infinity) of 3beta-hydroxy tibolone. The rate of absorption of tibolone and the rates of absorption or formation of the 3alpha- and 3beta-hydroxy tibolones were significantly higher after the 1.25 mg dose than after the 2.5 mg tablet, resulting in increases of 32{\%}, 27{\%} and 17{\%} for the dose normalized-C(max) of tibolone and the 3alpha- and 3beta-hydroxy tibolones, respectively. tmax for tibolone and its metabolites was 12-27{\%} less after 1.25 mg compared to 2.5 mg, which was statistically significant. The two formulations were bioequivalent with respect to the dose-normalized AUC(0, infinity) and the AUC(0,t(fix)) values for the 3alpha-hydroxy tibolone (ratio point estimate [90{\%}, confidence limits]: 1.08 [1.04, 1.14] and 1.08 [1.03, 1.13], respectively) and for the 3beta-hydroxy tibolone (1.07 [1.01, 1.14] and 1.04 [0.96, 1.12], respectively). Both formulations were also bioequivalent with respect to CL/F kg(-1) and t(1/2). CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of tibolone are similar in early (age 45-55 years) and late (65-75 years) postmenopausal women. The 2.5 and 1.25 mg tablets are bioequivalent with respect to the extent of absorption. The rate of absorption or formation of the metabolites of tibolone were not bioequivalent, but these differences are considered to have no clinical relevance in view of the chronic administration of tibolone.},

abstract = {The intestinal microbiota is known to regulate host energy homeostasis and can be influenced by high-calorie diets. However, changes affecting the ecosystem at the functional level are still not well characterized. We measured shifts in cecal bacterial communities in mice fed a carbohydrate or high-fat (HF) diet for 12 weeks at the level of the following: (i) diversity and taxa distribution by high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing; (ii) bulk and single-cell chemical composition by Fourier-transform infrared- (FT-IR) and Raman micro-spectroscopy and (iii) metaproteome and metabolome via high-resolution mass spectrometry. High-fat diet caused shifts in the diversity of dominant gut bacteria and altered the proportion of Ruminococcaceae (decrease) and Rikenellaceae (increase). FT-IR spectroscopy revealed that the impact of the diet on cecal chemical fingerprints is greater than the impact of microbiota composition. Diet-driven changes in biochemical fingerprints of members of the Bacteroidales and Lachnospiraceae were also observed at the level of single cells, indicating that there were distinct differences in cellular composition of dominant phylotypes under different diets. Metaproteome and metabolome analyses based on the occurrence of 1760 bacterial proteins and 86 annotated metabolites revealed distinct HF diet-specific profiles. Alteration of hormonal and anti-microbial networks, bile acid and bilirubin metabolism and shifts towards amino acid and simple sugars metabolism were observed. We conclude that a HF diet markedly affects the gut bacterial ecosystem at the functional level.},

The global human metabolic network, termed Recon 1, has recently been reconstructed allowing the systems analysis of human metabolic physiology and pathology. Utilizing high-throughput data, Recon 1 has recently been tailored to different cells and tissues, including the liver, kidney, brain, and alveolar macrophage. These models have shown utility in the study of systems medicine. However, no integrated analysis between human tissues has been done.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To describe tissue-specific functions, Recon 1 was tailored to describe metabolism in three human cells: adipocytes, hepatocytes, and myocytes. These cell-specific networks were manually curated and validated based on known cellular metabolic functions. To study intercellular interactions, a novel multi-tissue type modeling approach was developed to integrate the metabolic functions for the three cell types, and subsequently used to simulate known integrated metabolic cycles. In addition, the multi-tissue model was used to study diabetes: a pathology with systemic properties. High-throughput data was integrated with the network to determine differential metabolic activity between obese and type II obese gastric bypass patients in a whole-body context.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The multi-tissue type modeling approach presented provides a platform to study integrated metabolic states. As more cell and tissue-specific models are released, it is critical to develop a framework in which to study their interdependencies.},

abstract = {Recent observations support the importance of ceramide synthesis de novo in the induction of apoptosis. However, the downstream targets of de novo-synthesized ceramide are unknown. Here we show that palmitate incorporated into ceramide and induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in astrocytes. These effects of palmitate were exacerbated when fatty acid breakdown was uncoupled and were not evident in neurons, which show a very low capacity to take up and metabolize palmitate. Palmitate-induced apoptosis of astrocytes was prevented by L-cycloserine and fumonisin B1, two inhibitors of ceramide synthesis de novo, and by PD098059, an inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Accordingly, palmitate activated ERK by a process that was dependent on ceramide synthesis de novo and Raf-1, but independent of kinase suppressor of Ras. Other potential targets of ceramide in the control of cell fate, namely, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase B, were not significantly affected in astrocytes exposed to palmitate. Results show that the Raf-1/ERK cascade is the selective downstream target of de novo-synthesized ceramide in the induction of apoptosis in astrocytes and also highlight the importance of ceramide synthesis de novo in apoptosis of astrocytes, which might have pathophysiological relevance.},

abstract = {Astrocytes play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we showed that saturated free fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA), upregulates $\beta$-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) level and amyloidogenesis in primary rat neurons mediated by astrocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which conditioned media from PA-treated astrocytes upregulates BACE1 level in neurons are unknown. This study demonstrates that serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) in the astrocytes increases ceramide levels, which enhances the release of cytokines that mediate the activation of neural and acidic sphingomyelinase (SMase) in the neurons, to propagate the deleterious effects of PA (i.e., BACE1 upregulation). In support of the relevance of SPT in AD, our laboratory recently measured and found SPT levels to be significantly upregulated in AD brains as compared with controls. Cytokines, namely tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ and interleukin-1$\beta$, released into the conditioned media of PA-treated astrocytes activate neural and acidic SMase in the neurons. Neutralizing the cytokines in the PA-treated astrocyte conditioned media reduced BACE1 upregulation. However, inhibiting SPT in the astrocytes decreased the levels of both tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ and interleukin-1$\beta$ in the conditioned media, which in turn reduced the SMase activities and BACE1 level in primary neurons. Thus, our results suggest that the activation of the astrocytes by PA is mediated by SPT, and the activated astrocytes increases BACE1 level in the neurons; the latter is mediate by the SMases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Systems level modelling and simulations of biological processes are proving to be invaluable in obtaining a quantitative and dynamic perspective of various aspects of cellular function. In particular, constraint-based analyses of metabolic networks have gained considerable popularity for simulating cellular metabolism, of which flux balance analysis (FBA), is most widely used. Unlike mechanistic simulations that depend on accurate kinetic data, which are scarcely available, FBA is based on the principle of conservation of mass in a network, which utilizes the stoichiometric matrix and a biologically relevant objective function to identify optimal reaction flux distributions. FBA has been used to analyse genome-scale reconstructions of several organisms; it has also been used to analyse the effect of perturbations, such as gene deletions or drug inhibitions in silico. This article reviews the usefulness of FBA as a tool for gaining biological insights, advances in methodology enabling integration of regulatory information and thermodynamic constraints, and finally addresses the challenges that lie ahead. Various use scenarios and biological insights obtained from FBA, and applications in fields such metabolic engineering and drug target identification, are also discussed. Genome-scale constraint-based models have an immense potential for building and testing hypotheses, as well as to guide experimentation.},

Here, we report the development of an immunopanning method to acutely purify astrocytes from fetal, juvenile, and adult human brains and to maintain these cells in serum-free cultures. We found that human astrocytes have abilities similar to those of murine astrocytes in promoting neuronal survival, inducing functional synapse formation, and engulfing synaptosomes. In contrast to existing observations in mice, we found that mature human astrocytes respond robustly to glutamate. Next, we performed RNA sequencing of healthy human astrocytes along with astrocytes from epileptic and tumor foci and compared these to human neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells (available at http://www.brainrnaseq.org). With these profiles, we identified novel human-specific astrocyte genes and discovered a transcriptome-wide transformation between astrocyte precursor cells and mature post-mitotic astrocytes. These data represent some of the first cell-type-specific molecular profiles of the healthy and diseased human brain.},

abstract = {The central nervous system (CNS) shows dynamic immune and inflammatory responses  to a variety of insults having crucial implications for reactive gliosis. Glial cells in the CNS serve not only as the source, but also as targets of proinflammatory mediators. Undoubtedly, these cells efficiently work towards the disposal of tissue debris and promotion of wound healing as well as tissue repair. However, these non-neuronal glial cells synthesize and release numerous inflammatory mediators, which can be detrimental to neurons, axons, myelin, and the glia themselves. While an acute insult is typically transient and unlikely to be detrimental to neuronal survival, chronic neuroinflammation is a long-standing and often self-perpetuating response, which persists even long after the initial injury or insult. It can serve as a point of origin for diverse neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the contribution of metabolic dysfunction and mitochondrial failure to the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative conditions are also characterized by increased oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses and autophagy defects. Furthermore, neuroinflammatory conditions are accompanied by an alteration in glial energy metabolism. Here, we comprehensively review the metabolic hallmarks of glia-mediated neuroinflammation and how the glial metabolic shift orchestrates the neuroinflammatory response and pathophysiology of diverse neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Constraint-based models of metabolism are a widely used framework for predicting flux distributions in genome-scale biochemical networks. The number of published methods for integration of transcriptomic data into constraint-based models has been rapidly increasing. So far the predictive capability of these methods has not been critically evaluated and compared. This work presents a survey of recently published methods that use transcript levels to try to improve metabolic flux predictions either by generating flux distributions or by creating context-specific models. A subset of these methods is then systematically evaluated using published data from three different case studies in E. coli and S. cerevisiae. The flux predictions made by different methods using transcriptomic data are compared against experimentally determined extracellular and intracellular fluxes (from 13C-labeling data). The sensitivity of the results to method-specific parameters is also evaluated, as well as their robustness to noise in the data. The results show that none of the methods outperforms the others for all cases. Also, it is observed that for many conditions, the predictions obtained by simple flux balance analysis using growth maximization and parsimony criteria are as good or better than those obtained using methods that incorporate transcriptomic data. We further discuss the differences in the mathematical formulation of the methods, and their relation to the results we have obtained, as well as the connection to the underlying biological principles of metabolic regulation.},

@article{Cakir2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is a daunting task to identify all the metabolic pathways of brain energy metabolism and develop a dynamic simulation environment that will cover a time scale ranging from seconds to hours. To simplify this task and make it more practicable, we undertook stoichiometric modeling of brain energy metabolism with the major aim of including the main interacting pathways in and between astrocytes and neurons. MODEL: The constructed model includes central metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle), lipid metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, amino acid metabolism (synthesis and catabolism), the well-known glutamate-glutamine cycle, other coupling reactions between astrocytes and neurons, and neurotransmitter metabolism. This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive attempt at stoichiometric modeling of brain metabolism to date in terms of its coverage of a wide range of metabolic pathways. We then attempted to model the basal physiological behaviour and hypoxic behaviour of the brain cells where astrocytes and neurons are tightly coupled. RESULTS: The reconstructed stoichiometric reaction model included 217 reactions (184 internal, 33 exchange) and 216 metabolites (183 internal, 33 external) distributed in and between astrocytes and neurons. Flux balance analysis (FBA) techniques were applied to the reconstructed model to elucidate the underlying cellular principles of neuron-astrocyte coupling. Simulation of resting conditions under the constraints of maximization of glutamate/glutamine/GABA cycle fluxes between the two cell types with subsequent minimization of Euclidean norm of fluxes resulted in a flux distribution in accordance with literature-based findings. As a further validation of our model, the effect of oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) on fluxes was simulated using an FBA-derivative approach, known as minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA). The results show the power of the constructed model to simulate disease behaviour on the flux level, and its potential to analyze cellular metabolic behaviour in silico. CONCLUSION: The predictive power of the constructed model for the key flux distributions, especially central carbon metabolism and glutamate-glutamine cycle fluxes, and its application to hypoxia is promising. The resultant acceptable predictions strengthen the power of such stoichiometric models in the analysis of mammalian cell metabolism.},

abstract = {Obesity and type 2 diabetes are major worldwide public health issues where there appears to be a relationship between total fat intake and obesity. In addition, the mechanisms of long-term and excessive high-fat diet (HFD) intake in the development of obesity still need to be elucidated. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a major site involved in the regulation of glucose and energy homeostasis where "metabolic sensing neurons" integrate metabolic signals from the periphery. Among these signals, fatty acids (FA) modulate the activity of VMH neurons utilizing the FA translocator/CD36 which plays a critical role in the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis. During low fat diet (LFD) intake, FA are oxidized by VMH astrocytes to fuel their on-going metabolic needs. However, HFD intake causes VMH astrocytes to utilize FA to generate ketones bodies. We postulate that these astrocyte-derived ketone bodies are exported to neurons where they produce excess ATP and ROS which override CD36-mediated FA sensing and act as a signal to decrease short-term food intake. On HFD, VMH astrocyte-produced ketones reduce elevated caloric intake to LFD levels after 3 d in rats genetically-predisposed to resist (DR) diet-induced obesity (DIO), but not leptin resistant DIO rats. This suggests that, while VMH ketone production on HFD can contribute to protection from obesity, the inherent leptin resistance overrides this inhibitory action of ketone bodies on food intake. Thus, astrocytes and neurons form a tight metabolic unit that is able to monitor circulating nutrients in order to alter food intake and energy homeostasis.},

abstract = {Metabolic models have been used to elucidate important aspects of brain metabolism in recent years. This work applies for the first time the concept of isotopic transient 13C metabolic flux analysis (MFA) to estimate intracellular fluxes in primary cultures of astrocytes. This methodology comprehensively explores the information provided by 13C labeling time-courses of intracellular metabolites after administration of a 13C-labeled substrate. Cells were incubated with medium containing [1-13C]glucose for 24 h and samples of cell supernatant and extracts collected at different time points were then analyzed by mass spectrometry and/or high performance liquid chromatography. Metabolic fluxes were estimated by fitting a carbon labeling network model to isotopomer profiles experimentally determined. Both the fast isotopic equilibrium of glycolytic metabolite pools and the slow labeling dynamics of TCA cycle intermediates are described well by the model. The large pools of glutamate and aspartate which are linked to the TCA cycle via reversible aminotransferase reactions are likely to be responsible for the observed delay in equilibration of TCA cycle intermediates. Furthermore, it was estimated that 11{\%} of the glucose taken up by astrocytes was diverted to the pentose phosphate pathway. In addition, considerable fluxes through pyruvate carboxylase [PC; PC/pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) ratio = 0.5], malic enzyme (5{\%} of the total pyruvate production), and catabolism of branched-chained amino acids (contributing with ∼40{\%} to total acetyl-CoA produced) confirmed the significance of these pathways to astrocytic metabolism. Consistent with the need of maintaining cytosolic redox potential, the fluxes through the malate-aspartate shuttle and the PDH pathway were comparable. Finally, the estimated glutamate/$\alpha$-ketoglutarate exchange rate (∼0.7 $\mu$mol mg prot-1 h-1) was similar to the TCA cycle flux. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the potential of isotopic transient MFA for a comprehensive analysis of energy metabolism.},

Neurons are far more susceptible to ischemic damage than neighboring astrocytes, but astrocytes have diverse and important functions in many aspects of ischemic brain damage. Here we review three main roles of astrocytes in ischemic brain damage. First, we consider astrocyte glycogen stores, which can defend the brain against hypoglycemic brain damage but may aggravate brain damage during ischemia due to enhanced lactic acidosis. Second, we review recent breakthroughs in understanding astrocytic mechanisms of transmitter release, particularly for those transmitters with known roles in ischemic brain damage: glutamate, D-serine, ATP and adenosine. Third, we discuss the role of gap-junctionally connected networks of astrocytes in mediating the spread of damaging molecules to healthy 'bystanders' during infarct expansion in stroke.},

abstract = {The computational study of human metabolism has been advanced with the advent of the first generic (non-tissue specific) stoichiometric model of human metabolism. In this study, we present a new algorithm for rapid reconstruction of tissue-specific genome-scale models of human metabolism. The algorithm generates a tissue-specific model from the generic human model by integrating a variety of tissue-specific molecular data sources, including literature-based knowledge, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and phenotypic data. Applying the algorithm, we constructed the first genome-scale stoichiometric model of hepatic metabolism. The model is verified using standard cross-validation procedures, and through its ability to carry out hepatic metabolic functions. The model's flux predictions correlate with flux measurements across a variety of hormonal and dietary conditions, and improve upon the predictive performance obtained using the original, generic human model (prediction accuracy of 0.67 versus 0.46). Finally, the model better predicts biomarker changes in genetic metabolic disorders than the generic human model (accuracy of 0.67 versus 0.59). The approach presented can be used to construct other human tissue-specific models, and be applied to other organisms.},

abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) was performed on mouse embryonic stem cells cultured under three distinct differentiation conditions: classical embryoid body formation (EB), and on surfaces coated with either gelatin (GEL) or matrigel (MAT). MFA was based on 15 metabolic reactions and eight transport steps, and was carried out based on measurements of four substrates and/or metabolites: glucose, lactate, glutamine, and glutamate. Fluxes representing biomass production remained fairly constant for all three culture conditions with at most a 40{\%} variation. In contrast, major temporal variations, up to 500{\%}, were observed for all other major central metabolic fluxes across all culture conditions. Fluxes were compared to gene-expression patterns measured by microarray analysis. Particularly interesting is the correlation between the metabolic fluxes with expression patterns of the corresponding genes of the pyruvate to lactate reaction, whereby the genes for several isoforms of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme were examined. The patterns of this flux were notably different in the EB cultures compared to the GEL and MAT cultures and reflected differences in oxygen and nutrient transport in EB vs. the GEL and MAT cultures. Another novel finding of this study is an event occurring between Days 4 and 5 of differentiation, which was identified by a notable change in both the metabolic fluxes and gene-expression patterns. This suggests that metabolic patterns can be used as effective beacons of changes in differentiating stem cells. Overall, and qualitatively, core metabolic fluxes, under the three culture conditions examined, correlated well with gene-expression patterns.},

abstract = {Systems level modelling and simulations of biological processes are proving to be invaluable in obtaining a quantitative and dynamic perspective of various aspects of cellular function. In particular, constraint-based analyses of metabolic networks have gained considerable popularity for simulating cellular metabolism, of which flux balance analysis (FBA), is most widely used. Unlike mechanistic simulations that depend on accurate kinetic data, which are scarcely available, FBA is based on the principle of conservation of mass in a network, which utilizes the stoichiometric matrix and a biologically relevant objective function to identify optimal reaction flux distributions. FBA has been used to analyse genome-scale reconstructions of several organisms; it has also been used to analyse the effect of perturbations, such as gene deletions or drug inhibitions in silico. This article reviews the usefulness of FBA as a tool for gaining biological insights, advances in methodology enabling integration of regulatory information and thermodynamic constraints, and finally addresses the challenges that lie ahead. Various use scenarios and biological insights obtained from FBA, and applications in fields such metabolic engineering and drug target identification, are also discussed. Genome-scale constraint-based models have an immense potential for building and testing hypotheses, as well as to guide experimentation.},

abstract = {Author SummaryGenome-scale models (GEMs) are large stoichiometric models of cell metabolism, where the goal is to incorporate every metabolic transformation that an organism can perform. Such models have been extensively used for the study of bacterial metabolism, in particular for metabolic engineering purposes. More recently, the use of GEMs for eukaryotic organisms has become increasingly widespread. Since these models typically involve thousands of metabolic reactions, the reconstruction and validation of them can be a very complex task. We have developed a software suite, RAVEN Toolbox, which aims at automating parts of the reconstruction process in order to allow for faster reconstruction of high-quality GEMs. The software is particularly well suited for reconstruction of models for eukaryotic organisms, due to how it deals with sub-cellular localization of reactions. We used the software for reconstructing a model of the filamentous fungi Penicillium chrysogenum, the organism used in penicillin production and an important microbial cell factory. The resulting model was validated through an extensive literature survey and by comparison with published fermentation data. The model was used for the identification of transcriptionally regulated metabolic bottlenecks in order to increase the yield in penicillin fermentations. In this paper we present the RAVEN Toolbox and the GEM for P. chrysogenum.},

Specifically, this software allows predictive computations of both steady-state and dynamic optimal growth behavior, the effects of gene deletions, comprehensive robustness analyses, sampling the range of possible cellular metabolic states and the determination of network modules. Functions enabling these calculations are included in the toolbox, allowing a user to input a genome-scale metabolic model distributed in Systems Biology Markup Language format and perform these calculations with just a few lines of code. The results are predictions of cellular behavior that have been verified as accurate in a growing body of research.

The size and complexity of these networks prohibit manual drawing and thereby urge the need of dedicated visualization techniques. An efficient representation of such a network should preserve the topological information of metabolic pathways while respecting biological drawing conventions. These constraints complicate the automatic generation of such visualization as it raises graph drawing issues. In this paper we propose a method to lay out the entire metabolic network while preserving the pathway informa- tion as much as possible. That method is flexible as it enables the user to define whether or not node duplication should be performed, to preserve or not the network topology. Our technique combines partitioning, node place- ment and edge bundling to provide a pseudo-orthogonal visualization of the metabolic network. To ease pathway information retrieval, we also provide complementary interaction tools that emphasize relevant pathways in the entire metabolic context.},

@article{Reznik2013,
abstract = {Stoichiometric models of metabolism, such as flux balance analysis (FBA), are classically applied to predicting steady state rates - or fluxes - of metabolic reactions in genome-scale metabolic networks. Here we revisit the central assumption of FBA, i.e. that intracellular metabolites are at steady state, and show that deviations from flux balance (i.e. flux imbalances) are informative of some features of in vivo metabolite concentrations. Mathematically, the sensitivity of FBA to these flux imbalances is captured by a native feature of linear optimization, the dual problem, and its corresponding variables, known as shadow prices. First, using recently published data on chemostat growth of Saccharomyces cerevisae under different nutrient limitations, we show that shadow prices anticorrelate with experimentally measured degrees of growth limitation of intracellular metabolites. We next hypothesize that metabolites which are limiting for growth (and thus have very negative shadow price) cannot vary dramatically in an uncontrolled way, and must respond rapidly to perturbations. Using a collection of published datasets monitoring the time-dependent metabolomic response of Escherichia coli to carbon and nitrogen perturbations, we test this hypothesis and find that metabolites with negative shadow price indeed show lower temporal variation following a perturbation than metabolites with zero shadow price. Finally, we illustrate the broader applicability of flux imbalance analysis to other constraint-based methods. In particular, we explore the biological significance of shadow prices in a constraint-based method for integrating gene expression data with a stoichiometric model. In this case, shadow prices point to metabolites that should rise or drop in concentration in order to increase consistency between flux predictions and gene expression data. In general, these results suggest that the sensitivity of metabolic optima to violations of the steady state constraints carries biologically significant information on the processes that control intracellular metabolites in the cell.},

@article{MinLee2008,
abstract = {Extracellular cues affect signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes to elicit cellular responses. Although intracellular signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks are highly integrated, previous analyses have largely focused on independent processes (e.g., metabolism) without considering the interplay that exists among them. However, there is evidence that many diseases arise from multifunctional components with roles throughout signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a flux balance analysis (FBA)-based strategy, referred to as integrated dynamic FBA (idFBA), that dynamically simulates cellular phenotypes arising from integrated networks. The idFBA framework requires an integrated stoichiometric reconstruction of signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes. It assumes quasi-steady-state conditions for "fast" reactions and incorporates "slow" reactions into the stoichiometric formalism in a time-delayed manner. To assess the efficacy of idFBA, we developed a prototypic integrated system comprising signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes with network features characteristic of actual systems and incorporated kinetic parameters based on typical time scales observed in literature. idFBA was applied to the prototypic system, which was evaluated for different environments and gene regulatory rules. In addition, we applied the idFBA framework in a similar manner to a representative module of the single-cell eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ultimately, idFBA facilitated quantitative, dynamic analysis of systemic effects of extracellular cues on cellular phenotypes and generated comparable time-course predictions when contrasted with an equivalent kinetic model. Since idFBA solves a linear programming problem and does not require an exhaustive list of detailed kinetic parameters, it may be efficiently scaled to integrated intracellular systems that incorporate signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes at the genome scale, such as the S. cerevisiae system presented here.},

abstract = {A large number of computational methods have been developed for analyzing differential gene expression in RNA-seq data. We describe a comprehensive evaluation of common methods using the SEQC benchmark dataset and ENCODE data. We consider a number of key features, including normalization, accuracy of differential expression detection and differential expression analysis when one condition has no detectable expression. We find significant differences among the methods, but note that array-based methods adapted to RNA-seq data perform comparably to methods designed for RNA-seq. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of replicate samples significantly improves detection power over increased sequencing depth.},

These adaptive mechanisms are also responsible for significant metabolic changes that feedback with the central clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, as well as with oscillators of peripheral tissues. In this review we attempt to use a systems biology approach to explore such interactions as a whole; to answer two fundamental questions: (1) how dependent are these adaptive responses and subsequent events leading to NCD with their state of synchrony with the SCN and peripheral oscillators? And, (2) How could modifiers of the activity of SCN for instance, food intake, exercise, and drugs, be potentially used to modulate systemic inflammation and ER stress to ameliorate or even prevent NCDs?{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The multifactorial nature of traumatic brain injury (TBI), especially the complex secondary tissue injury involving intertwined networks of molecular pathways that mediate cellular behavior, has confounded attempts to elucidate the pathology underlying the progression of TBI. Here, systems biology strategies are exploited to identify novel molecular mechanisms and protein indicators of brain injury. To this end, we performed a meta-analysis of four distinct high-throughput gene expression studies involving different animal models of TBI. By using canonical pathways and a large human protein-interaction network as a scaffold, we separately overlaid the gene expression data from each study to identify molecular signatures that were conserved across the different studies. At 24 hr after injury, the significantly activated molecular signatures were nonspecific to TBI, whereas the significantly suppressed molecular signatures were specific to the nervous system. In particular, we identified a suppressed subnetwork consisting of 58 highly interacting, coregulated proteins associated with synaptic function. We selected three proteins from this subnetwork, postsynaptic density protein 95, nitric oxide synthase 1, and disrupted in schizophrenia 1, and hypothesized that their abundance would be significantly reduced after TBI. In a penetrating ballistic-like brain injury rat model of severe TBI, Western blot analysis confirmed our hypothesis. In addition, our analysis recovered 12 previously identified protein biomarkers of TBI. The results suggest that systems biology may provide an efficient, high-yield approach to generate testable hypotheses that can be experimentally validated to identify novel mechanisms of action and molecular indicators of TBI. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Biological systems are complex and comprehend multiple scales of organisation. Hence, holistic approaches are necessary to capture the behaviour of these entities from the molecular and cellular to the whole organism level. This also applies to the understanding and treatment of different diseases. Traditional systems biology has been successful in describing different biological phenomena at the cellular level, but it still lacks of a holistic description of the multi-scale interactions within the body. The importance of the physiological context is of particular interest in inflammation. Regulatory agencies have urged the scientific community to increase the translational power of bio-medical research and it has been recognised that modelling and simulation could be a path to follow. Interestingly, in pharma R{\&}D, modelling and simulation has been employed since a long time ago. Systems pharmacology, and particularly physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models, serve as a suitable framework to integrate the available and emerging knowledge at different levels of the drug development process. Systems medicine and pharmacology of inflammation will potentially benefit from this framework in order to better understand inflammatory diseases and to help to transfer the vast knowledge on the molecular and cellular level into a more physiological context. Ultimately, this may lead to reliable predictions of clinical outcomes such as disease progression or treatment efficacy, contributing thereby to a better care of patients.},

To do so, we must confront and gain an understanding of inflammation, a complex, nonlinear process central to many diseases that affect both industrialized and developing nations. Herein, we describe the work aimed at creating a rational, engineering-oriented and evidence-based synthesis of inflammation geared towards rapid clinical application. This comprehensive approach, which we call 'Translational Systems Biology', to date has been utilized for in silico studies of sepsis, trauma/hemorrhage/traumatic brain injury, acute liver failure and wound healing. This framework has now allowed us to suggest how to modulate acute inflammation in a rational and individually optimized fashion using engineering principles applied to a biohybrid device. We suggest that we are on the cusp of fulfilling the promise of in silico modeling for personalized medicine for inflammatory disease.},

Just as crucial will be the use of systems biology to integrate and make sense of them. We review previous work using systems biology to study related pathologies such as asthma/allergy, and NSAID metabolism.

abstract = {Systems biology is an approach to understanding living systems that focuses on modeling diverse types of high-dimensional interactions to develop a more comprehensive understanding of complex phenotypes manifested by the system. High-throughput molecular, cellular, and physiologic profiling of populations is coupled with bioinformatic and computational techniques to identify new functional roles for genes, regulatory elements, and metabolites in the context of the molecular networks that define biological processes associated with system physiology. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of asthma and allergic diseases, a systems biology approach is attractive, as it has the potential to model the myriad connections and interdependencies between genetic predisposition, environmental perturbations, regulatory intermediaries, and molecular sequelae that ultimately lead to diverse disease phenotypes and treatment responses across individuals. The increasing availability of high-throughput technologies has enabled system-wide profiling of the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, microbiome, and metabolome, providing fodder for systems biology approaches to examine asthma and allergy at a more holistic level. In this article we review the technologies and approaches for system-wide profiling, as well as their more recent applications to asthma and allergy. We discuss approaches for integrating multiscale data through network analyses and provide perspective on how individually captured health profiles will contribute to more accurate systems biology views of asthma and allergy.},

abstract = {Proteomics is a field of study that characterises a complete profile of proteins present in a given cell, tissue or biological system. Recent advances in proteomics research made possible the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases. The field of neurodegenerative diseases is particularly well suited for proteomic analysis, given the multifactorial nature of the diseases and complexity of the nervous system. As increasing evidence indicates that microglia-associated chronic neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, microglial activation may be a potential drug target in CNS disorders. On the basis of both the neuroprotective and neurotoxic role of microglia, the proteomic analysis of microglial signalling and neuroinflammation may thus be used for the identification and validation of novel drug targets as well as for the discovery of useful biomarkers of disease diagnosis and progression in the CNS.

Many of these functions are executed via secreted proteins. To analyze the astrocyte secretome, a combination of shotgun proteomics and bioinformatics was employed to analyze conditioned media from primary murine astrocyte cultures. Both two- and one-dimensional LC-MS/MS were used to analyze astrocyte secreted proteins, resulting in the identification of over 420 proteins. To refine our results, the intracellular protein contaminants were removed in silico using a cytoplasmic control. In additional rounds of refinement, putative secreted proteins were subjected to analysis by SignalP, SecretomeP, and gene ontology analysis, yielding a refined list of 187 secreted proteins. In conclusion, the use of shotgun proteomics combined with multiple rounds of data refinement produced a high quality catalog of astrocyte secreted proteins.},

Systems biology and computational modeling have been touted as potential avenues by which to break through this logjam. However, few mechanistic computational approaches are utilized in a manner that is fully cognizant of the inherent clinical realities in which the drugs developed through this ostensibly rational process will be ultimately used. In this article, we present a Translational Systems Biology approach to inflammation. This approach is based on the use of mechanistic computational modeling centered on inherent clinical applicability, namely that a unified suite of models can be applied to generate in silico clinical trials, individualized computational models as tools for personalized medicine, and rational drug and device design based on disease mechanism.},

abstract = {Astrocytes play a key role in maintenance of neuronal functions in the central nervous system by producing various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which act as a molecular coordinator of neuron-glia communication. At the site of neuroinflammation, astrocyte-derived cytokines and chemokines play both neuroprotective and neurotoxic roles in brain lesions of human neurological diseases. At present, the comprehensive profile of human astrocyte-derived cytokines and chemokines during inflammation remains to be fully characterized. We investigated the cytokine secretome profile of highly purified human astrocytes by using a protein microarray. Non-stimulated human astrocytes in culture expressed eight cytokines, including G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO$\alpha$ (CXCL1), IL-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), MCP-1 (CCL2), MIF and Serpin E1. Following stimulation with IL-1$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$, activated astrocytes newly produced IL-1$\beta$, IL-1ra, TNF-$\alpha$, IP-10 (CXCL10), MIP-1$\alpha$ (CCL3) and RANTES (CCL5), in addition to the induction of sICAM-1 and complement component 5. Database search indicated that most of cytokines and chemokines produced by non-stimulated and activated astrocytes are direct targets of the transcription factor NF-kB. These results indicated that cultured human astrocytes express a distinct set of NF-kB-target cytokines and chemokines in resting and activated conditions, suggesting that the NF-kB signaling pathway differentially regulates gene expression of cytokines and chemokines in human astrocytes under physiological and inflammatory conditions.},

abstract = {The generation and use of metabolic network reconstructions has increased over recent years. The development of such reconstructions has typically involved a time-consuming, manual process. Recent work has shown that steps undertaken in reconstructing such metabolic networks are amenable to automation. The SuBliMinaL Toolbox (http://www.mcisb.org/subliminal/) facilitates the reconstruction process by providing a number of independent modules to perform common tasks, such as generating draft reconstructions, determining metabolite protonation state, mass and charge balancing reactions, suggesting intracellular compartmentalisation, adding transport reactions and a biomass function, and formatting the reconstruction to be used in third-party analysis packages. The individual modules manipulate reconstructions encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), and can be chained to generate a reconstruction pipeline, or used individually during a manual curation process. This work describes the individual modules themselves, and a study in which the modules were used to develop a metabolic reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the existing data resources KEGG and MetaCyc. The automatically generated reconstruction is analysed for blocked reactions, and suggestions for future improvements to the toolbox are discussed.},

abstract = {HECT ubiquitin ligases are key components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is present in all eukaryotes. In this study, the patterns of emergence of HECT genes in plants are described. Phylogenetic and structural data indicate that viridiplantae have six main HECT subfamilies, which arose before the split that separated green algae from the rest of plants. It is estimated that the common ancestor of all plants contained seven HECT genes. Contrary to what happened in animals, the number of HECT genes has been kept quite constant in all lineages, both in chlorophyta and streptophyta, although evolutionary recent duplications are found in some species. Several of the genes found in plants may have originated very early in eukaryotic evolution, given that they have clear similarities, both in sequence and structure, to animal genes. Finally, in Arabidopsis thaliana, we found significant correlations in the expression patterns of HECT genes and some ancient, broadly expressed genes that belong to a different ubiquitin ligase family, called RBR. These results are discussed in the context of the evolution of the gene families required for ubiquitination in plants.},

abstract = {Current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and its function for memory formation in the behaving animal is limited. NMDAR-independent LTP in the CA1 region is thought to require activity of postsynaptic L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Cav1.x), but the underlying channel isoform remains unknown. We evaluated the function of the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel for spatial learning, synaptic plasticity, and triggering of learning-associated biochemical processes using a mouse line with an inactivation of the CACNA1C (Cav1.2) gene in the hippocampus and neocortex (Cav1.2(HCKO)). This model shows (1) a selective loss of protein synthesis-dependent NMDAR-independent Schaffer collateral/CA1 late-phase LTP (L-LTP), (2) a severe impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, and (3) decreased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and reduced cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent transcription in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our results provide strong evidence for a role of L-type Ca2+ channel-dependent, NMDAR-independent hippocampal L-LTP in the formation of spatial memory in the behaving animal and for a function of the MAPK/CREB (CRE-binding protein) signaling cascade in linking Cav1.2 channel-mediated Ca2+ influx to either process.},

These include protein kinases and phosphatases, G-protein coupled receptors, scaffolding proteins, and Ca2+-binding proteins. The cytoplasmic domains of the main pore forming alpha(1) subunit of Ca(v)1 offer a number of binding sites for these modulators, permitting fast and localized regulation of Ca2+ entry.

abstract = {Voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels mediate Ca(2+) entry into cells in response to membrane depolarization. Electrophysiological studies reveal different Ca(2+) currents designated L-, N-, P-, Q-, R-, and T-type. The high-voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels that have been characterized biochemically are complexes of a pore-forming alpha1 subunit of approximately 190-250 kDa; a transmembrane, disulfide-linked complex of alpha2 and delta subunits; an intracellular beta subunit; and in some cases a transmembrane gamma subunit. Ten alpha1 subunits, four alpha2delta complexes, four beta subunits, and two gamma subunits are known. The Cav1 family of alpha1 subunits conduct L-type Ca(2+) currents, which initiate muscle contraction, endocrine secretion, and gene transcription, and are regulated primarily by second messenger-activated protein phosphorylation pathways. The Cav2 family of alpha1 subunits conduct N-type, P/Q-type, and R-type Ca(2+) currents, which initiate rapid synaptic transmission and are regulated primarily by direct interaction with G proteins and SNARE proteins and secondarily by protein phosphorylation. The Cav3 family of alpha1 subunits conduct T-type Ca(2+) currents, which are activated and inactivated more rapidly and at more negative membrane potentials than other Ca(2+) current types. The distinct structures and patterns of regulation of these three families of Ca(2+) channels provide a flexible array of Ca(2+) entry pathways in response to changes in membrane potential and a range of possibilities for regulation of Ca(2+) entry by second messenger pathways and interacting proteins.},

abstract = {Myelination of the CNS is performed by oligodendrocytes (OLs), which have been implicated in brain disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. We have used the human oligodendroglial cell line MO3.13 to establish an OL reference proteome database. Proteins were prefractionationated by SDS-PAGE and after in-gel digestion subjected to nanoflow LC-MS analysis. Approximately 11 600 unique peptides were identified and, after stringent filtering, resulted in 2290 proteins representing nine distinct biological processes and various molecular classes and functions. OL-specific proteins, such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP), as well as other proteins involved in multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia were also identified and are discussed. Proteins of this dataset have also been classified according to their chromosomal origin for providing useful data to the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP). Given the importance of OLs in the etiology of demyelinating and oligodendrogial disorders, the MO3.13 proteome database is a valuable data resource.

L-type, dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels have been the most extensively characterized to date.

abstract = {L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+)channels (VGCC) play an important role in dendritic development, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have demonstrated that the gonadal steroid estrogen rapidly induces Ca(2+) influx in hippocampal neurons, which is required for neuroprotection and potentiation of LTP. The mechanism by which estrogen rapidly induces this Ca(2+) influx is not clearly understood. We show by electrophysiological studies that extremely low concentrations of estrogens acutely potentiate VGCC in hippocampal neurons, hippocampal slices, and HEK-293 cells transfected with neuronal L-type VGCC, in a manner that was estrogen receptor (ER)-independent. Equilibrium, competitive, and whole-cell binding assays indicate that estrogen directly interacts with the VGCC. Furthermore, a L-type VGCC antagonist to the dihydropyridine site displaced estrogen binding to neuronal membranes, and the effects of estrogen were markedly attenuated in a mutant, dihydropyridine-insensitive L-type VGCC, demonstrating a direct interaction of estrogens with L-type VGCC. Thus, estrogen-induced potentiation of calcium influx via L-type VGCC may link electrical events with rapid intracellular signaling seen with estrogen exposure leading to modulation of synaptic plasticity, neuroprotection, and memory formation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To review recent findings concerning Ca(2+) channel subtype/structure/function from electrophysiological and molecular biological studies and to explain Ca(2+) channel diseases and the actions of anesthetics on Ca(2+) channels. SOURCE: The information was obtained from articles published recently and from our published work. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels serve as one of the important mechanisms for Ca(2+) influx into the cells, enabling the regulation of intracellular concentration of free Ca(2+). Recent advances both in electrophysiology and in molecular biology have made it possible to observe channel activity directly and to investigate channel functions at molecular levels. The Ca(2+) channel can be divided into subtypes according to electrophysiological characteristics, and each subtype has its own gene. The L-type Ca(2+) channel is the target of a large number of clinically important drugs, especially dihydropyridines, and binding sites of Ca(2+) antagonists have been clarified. The effects of various kinds of anesthetics in a variety of cell types have been demonstrated, and some clinical effects of anesthetics can be explained by the effects on Ca(2+) channels. It has recently become apparent that some hereditary diseases such as hypokalemic periodic paralysis result from calcium channelopathies. CONCLUSION: Recent advances both in electrophysiology and in molecular biology have made it possible to clarify the Ca(2+) channel structures, functions, genes, and the anesthetic actions on the channels in detail. The effects of anesthetics on the Ca(2+) channels either of patients with hereditary channelopathies or using gene mutation techniques are left to be discovered.},

abstract = {Our group and others have demonstrated that 17??-estradiol (E2) induces neurotrophic and neuroprotective responses in hippocampal and cortical neurons which are dependent upon the Src/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways. The purpose of this study was to determine the upstream mechanism(s) that initiates the signaling cascade leading to E2-inducible neuroprotection. We tested the hypothesis that E2 activates rapid Ca 2+ influx in hippocampal neurons, which would lead to activation of the Src/ERK signaling cascade and up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein expression. Using fura-2 ratiometric Ca2+ imaging, we demonstrated that E2 induced a rapid rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca 2+]i) within minutes of exposure which was blocked by an L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist. Inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels resulted in a loss of E2 activation of the Src/ERK cascade, activation of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and subsequent increase in Bcl-2. Real-time intracellular Ca2+ imaging combined with pERK immunofluorescence, demonstrated that E2 induced [Ca2+]i was coincident with ERK activation in the same neuron. Small interfering RNA knockdown of CREB resulted in a loss of E2 activation of CREB and subsequent E2-induced increase of Bcl-2 expression. We further demonstrated the presence of specific membrane E2 binding sites in hippocampal neurons. Together, these data indicate that E2-induced Ca2+ influx via the L-type Ca2+ channel is required for E2 activation of the Src/ERK/CREB/Bcl-2 signaling. Implications of these data for understanding estrogen action in brain and use of estrogen therapy for prevention of neurodegenerative disease are discussed. ?? 2005 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling pathways have crucial roles in development from fertilization through differentiation to organogenesis. In the nervous system, Ca(2+) signals are important regulators for various neuronal functions, including formation and maturation of neuronal circuits and long-term memory. However, Ca(2+) signals are also involved in the earliest steps of neurogenesis including neural induction, differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons, and the neuro-glial switch. This review examines when and how Ca(2+) signals are generated during each of these steps with examples taken from in vivo studies in vertebrate embryos and from in vitro assays using embryonic and neural stem cells (NSCs). During the early phases of neurogenesis few investigations have been performed to study the downstream targets of Ca(2+) which posses EF-hand in their structure. This opens an entire field of research. We also discuss the highly specific nature of the Ca(2+) signaling pathway and its interaction with the other signaling pathways involved in early neural development.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) support the association of polymorphisms in the alpha 1C subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel gene (CACNA1C) with bipolar disorder. These studies extend a rich prior literature implicating dysfunction of L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, calcium channel blockers reduce Ca2+ flux by binding to the $\alpha$1 subunit of the LTCC and are used extensively for treating hypertension, preventing angina, cardiac arrhythmias and stroke. Calcium channel blockers have also been studied clinically in psychiatric conditions such as mood disorders and substance abuse/dependence, yielding conflicting results. In this review, we begin with a summary of LTCC pharmacology. For each category of disorder, this article then provides a review of animal and human data. In particular, we extensively focus on animal models of depression and clinical trials in mood disorders and substance abuse/dependence. Through examining rationale and study design of published clinical trials, we provide some of the possible reasons why we still do not have definitive evidence of efficacy of calcium-channel antagonists for mood disorders. Refinement of genetic results and target phenotypes, enrollment of adequate sample sizes in clinical trials and progress in physiologic and pharmacologic studies to synthesize tissue and isoform specific calcium channel antagonists, are all future challenges of research in this promising field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We now report that estrogen altered intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in neonatal astrocytes that expressed estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA in vitro. Western blotting revealed both ERalpha and ERbeta proteins in both the nuclear fractions and plasma-membrane fractions. Application of 17beta-estradiol (20 nm) to fura 2-loaded astrocytes in vitro stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) in 75{\%} of astrocytes with an EC(50) of 12.7 +/- 3.1 nm. This rapid action of estradiol was blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI 182,780. The membrane-impermeable estradiol-BSA induced a [Ca(2+)](i) flux that was statistically similar to estradiol. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) did not alter the effect of estradiol, but phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (10 microm) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (5 microm), an inhibitor of the inositol-1,4,5,-trisphosphate-gated intracellular Ca(2+) channel, significantly decreased the estradiol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) flux. Estradiol was unable to induce [Ca(2+)](i) flux in thapsigargin-depleted cells. These results indicate that estradiol mediates [Ca(2+)](i) flux in astrocytes through a membrane-associated ER that activates the phospholipase C pathway.},

The dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist nifedipine was used to test whether this slow neurotoxicity is mediated by a calcium influx through voltage-gated channels. Nifedipine had little effect on the widespread neuronal degeneration induced by brief exposure to high concentrations of NMDA but substantially attenuated the neurotoxicity produced by 24-hour exposure to submaximal concentrations of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate, kainate, or quinolinate. Calcium ion influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-dependent calcium channels may be an important step in the neuronal injury induced by the prolonged activation of NMDA or non-NMDA glutamate receptors.},

abstract = {How many types of calcium channels exist in neurones? This question is fundamental to understanding how calcium entry contributes to diverse neuronal functions such as transmitter release, neurite extension, spike initiation and rhythmic firing. There is considerable evidence for the presence of more than one type of Ca conductance in neurones and other cells. However, little is known about single-channel properties of diverse neuronal Ca channels, or their responsiveness to dihydropyridines, compounds widely used as labels in Ca channel purification. Here we report evidence for the coexistence of three types of Ca channel in sensory neurones of the chick dorsal root ganglion. In addition to a large conductance channel that contributes long-lasting current at strong depolarizations (L), and a relatively tiny conductance that underlies a transient current activated at weak depolarizations (T), we find a third type of unitary activity (N) that is neither T nor L. N-type Ca channels require strongly negative potentials for complete removal of inactivation (unlike L) and strong depolarizations for activation (unlike T). The dihydropyridine Ca agonist Bay K 8644 strongly increases the opening probability of L-, but not T- or N-type channels.},

abstract = {Until recently, steroid hormones were believed to act only on cells containing intracellular receptors. However, recent evidence suggests that steroids have specific and rapid effects at the cellular membrane. Using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, 17 beta-estradiol was found to reduce Ba2+ entry reversibly via Ca2+ channels in acutely dissociated and cultured neostriatal neurons. The effects were sex-specific, i.e., the reduction of Ba2+ currents was greater in neurons taken from female rats. 17 beta-Estradiol primarily targeted L-type currents, and their inhibition was detected reliably within seconds of administration. The maximum reduction by 17 beta-estradiol occurred at picomolar concentrations. 17 beta-Estradiol conjugated to bovine serum albumin also reduced Ba2+ currents, suggesting that the effect occurs at the membrane surface. Dialysis with GTP gamma S prevented reversal of the modulation, suggesting that 17 beta-estradiol acts via G-protein activation. 17 alpha-Estradiol also reduced Ba2+ currents but was significantly less effective than 17 beta-estradiol. Estriol and 4-hydroxyestradiol were found to reduce Ba2+ currents with similar efficacy to 17 beta-estradiol, whereas estrone and 2-methoxyestriol were less effective. Tamoxifen also reduced Ba2+ currents but did not occlude the effect of 17 beta-estradiol. These results suggest that at physiological concentrations, 17 beta-estradiol can have immediate actions on neostriatal neurons via nongenomic signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Potassium depolarization can increase the intracellular ionized calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)) of cultured astrocytes, but it is not known if astrocytes that have matured in the intact CNS also exhibit voltage-dependent [Ca2+](i) signalling. To address this issue, fluorometric measurements of [Ca2+](i) were obtained from astrocytes acutely isolated from young adult rat hippocampus. In control artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 5 mM [K+]0, average resting [Ca2+](i) was 195 nM. Elevation of [K+]0 to 50 mM caused [Ca2+](i) to increase 150 nM to 1 ??M above resting levels. The threshold [K+]0 necessary to evoke an elevation in [Ca2+](i) was 20-25 mM, and the magnitude of the [Ca2+](i) signal grew progressively with increasing [K+]0 (up to 50 mM). These [Ca2+], increases were blocked completely by removal of external Ca2+, and markedly suppressed by the calcium channel blockers verapamil (30 ??M and greater) and Co2+ (1 mM). Neither reversal of Na+-Ca2+ exchange, nor Ca2+-activated Ca2+ release, nor Ca2+ influx through stretch-activated channels contributed to the [Ca2+](i) increase. These results suggest that [K+]0-evoked [Ca2+](i) signals are mediated by influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. In contrast to results from cultured astrocytes and acutely isolated neurons, these [Ca2+](i) increases were insensitive to dihydropyridine compounds. We conclude that increases in interstitial [K+], observed in situ during several pathological conditions, trigger voltage-dependent [Ca2+](i) signals in astroglial cells. This may constitute an important form of neuron-to-glial communication.},

abstract = {Calcium ions play crucial roles in a large variety of cell functions. The recent proposal that changes in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in astrocytes underline a reciprocal communication system between neurons and astrocytes encourages the interest in the definition of the various components participating in this novel Ca2+ signaling system. We investigate here whether functional voltage-operated calcium channels (Ca2+ VOCs), which are clearly expressed in cultured astrocytes, participate in the regulation of [Ca2+]i also in astrocytes in situ. Depolarization with 40-60 mM K+ was used to analyze the activity of Ca2+ VOCs in Indo-1-loaded astrocytes in acute slices from the visual cortex and the CA1 hippocampal region of developing rats. We demonstrate here that the depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i increases in astrocytes are solely attributed to the activation of metabotropic receptors by neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, released by synaptic terminals on depolarization. In fact, (1) the K+-induced [Ca2+]i increases in astrocyte [Ca2+]i were potently reduced by alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine, a metabotropic glutamate receptor competitive inhibitor; (2) after emptying intracellular Ca2+ stores with cyclopiazonic acid, none of the astrocytes displayed a [Ca2+]i increase on the depolarizing stimulus; and (3) after inhibiting neurotransmitter secretion in neurons by incubating the slices with tetanus neurotoxin, no [Ca2+]i increase on K+ stimulation was observed in astrocytes. Finally, patch-clamp whole-cell recordings from hippocampal astrocytes in acute brain slices failed to reveal any voltage-dependent calcium currents. On the basis of these results, the various roles proposed for astrocyte Ca2+ VOCs in the CNS should be reconsidered.},

Immunostaining of the alpha2 subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels by the MANC-1 antibody was increased in reactive astrocytes in each of these forms of brain injury.

In all of these models of brain injury, there was no apparent redistribution or upregulation of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in neurons.

In untreated control cultures, L-type calcium currents were entirely absent. The induction of this calcium current was specific to cortical astrocytes and a closely related astrocyte type in white matter and did not occur in meningeal cells or oligodendrocytes. The ability of forskolin to induce L-type calcium current in astrocytes depended on previous culture of these cells in a permissive lot of serum for at least 48 hr. In addition, certain lots of sera caused expression of a voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel in untreated control cultures. Several possible mechanisms of calcium channel induction by cAMP are consistent with our data: modification of a silent channel already present in the membrane, indirect effect of cytoskeletal alteration, or insertion of channels from submembrane stores. If the environment in vivo is permissive, regulation of glial ion channels may be under neuronal control.},

Lactate dehydrogenase efflux was used as an index of cellular injury. Both types of cultures exhibited significantly less cellular injury when exposed to combined glucose-oxygen deprivation in the absence of extracellular calcium (e.g. lactate dehydrogenase efflux in undifferentiated cultures after 12 h of exposure: presence of calcium, 65.2 ?? 2.5{\%} vs. absence of calcium, 21.4 ?? 1.3{\%}). To further elucidate the mechanism by which extracellular calcium produces injury, we studied the effect of nimodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, on astroglial injury resulting from combined glucose-oxygen deprivation. Nimodipine decreased cellular injury in both types of cultures (e.g. lactate dehydrogenase efflux in undifferentiated cultures after 12 h of exposure: untreated, 65.4 ?? 2.2{\%} vs. 10 nM nimodipine, 44.6 ?? 4.2{\%}).

abstract = {Although vitamin D hormone (VDH; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)), the active metabolite of vitamin D, is the major Ca(2+)-regulatory steroid hormone in the periphery, it is not known whether it also modulates Ca(2+) homeostasis in brain neurons. Recently, chronic treatment with VDH was reported to protect brain neurons in both aging and animal models of stroke. However, it is unclear whether those actions were attributable to direct effects on brain cells or indirect effects mediated via peripheral pathways. VDH modulates L-type voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels (L-VSCCs) in peripheral tissues, and an increase in L-VSCCs appears linked to both brain aging and neuronal vulnerability. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that VDH has direct neuroprotective actions and, in parallel, targets L-VSCCs in hippocampal neurons. Primary rat hippocampal cultures, treated for several days with VDH, exhibited a U-shaped concentration-response curve for neuroprotection against excitotoxic insults: lower concentrations of VDH (1-100 nm) were protective, but higher, nonphysiological concentrations (500-1000 nm) were not. Parallel studies using patch-clamp techniques found a similar U-shaped curve in which L-VSCC current was reduced at lower VDH concentrations and increased at higher (500 nm) concentrations. Real-time PCR studies demonstrated that VDH monotonically downregulated mRNA expression for the alpha(1C) and alpha(1D) pore-forming subunits of L-VSCCs. However, 500 nm VDH also nonspecifically reduced a range of other mRNA species. Thus, these studies provide the first evidence of (1) direct neuroprotective actions of VDH at relatively low concentrations, and (2) selective downregulation of L-VSCC expression in brain neurons at the same, lower concentrations.},

abstract = {Very simple biochemical systems regulated at the level of gene expression or protein function are capable of complex dynamic behaviour. Among the various patterns of regulation associated with non-linear kinetics, multistability, which corresponds to a true switch between alternate steady states, allows a graded signal to be turned into a discontinuous evolution of the system along several possible distinct pathways, which can be either reversible or irreversible. Multistability plays a significant role in some of the basic processes of life. It might account for maintenance of phenotypic differences in the absence of genetic or environmental differences, as has been demonstrated experimentally for the regulation of the lactose operon in Escherichia coli. Cell differentiation might also be explained as multistability.},

abstract = {The affinity of a drug candidate for a biological membrane (its lipophilicity) is closely related to the pharmacologically crucial events of absorption, biodistribution, metabolization and excretion. The evolution of knowledge of biological membranes during the past two decades contrasts with the rudimentary parameter most commonly used to assess lipophilicity: Po/w, the octanol-water partition coefficient. Po/w is especially unrealistic when testing molecules that are polar or partially charged. By contrast, lipid vesicle-based methods determine the extent of the actual partition of a drug to a membrane much more accurately, and have the additional advantage of enabling the choice of the lipid composition considered most suitable to answer a specific biological or pharmaceutical question. In addition, some of these methods are appropriate for high throughput screening, thus shifting determinations of membrane partition to a more preliminary stage of drug development. This streamlines research and development, by saving the time and money that would be spent on unpromising leads. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Frecer2004,
abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), shed by gram-negative bacteria during infection and antimicrobial therapy, may lead to lethal endotoxic shock syndrome. A rational design strategy based on the presumed mechanism of antibacterial effect was adopted to design cationic antimicrobial peptides capable of binding to LPS through tandemly repeated sequences of alternating cationic and nonpolar residues. The peptides were designed to achieve enhanced antimicrobial potency due to initial bacterial membrane binding with a reduced risk of endotoxic shock. The peptides designed displayed binding affinities to LPS and lipid A (LA) in the low micromolar range and by molecular modeling were predicted to form amphipathic -hairpin-like structures when they bind to LPS or LA. They also exhibited strong effects against gram-negative bacteria, with MICs in the nanomolar range, and low cytotoxic and hemolytic activities at concentrations significantly exceeding their MICs. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis of peptide sequences and their antimicro- bial, cytotoxic, and hemolytic activities revealed that site-directed substitutions of residues in the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic peptides with less lipophilic residues selectively decrease the hemolytic effect without significantly affecting the antimicrobial or cytotoxic activity. On the other hand, the antimicrobial effect can be enhanced by substitutions in the polar face with more polar residues, which increase the amphipathicity of the peptide. On the basis of the QSARs, new analogs that have strong antimicrobial effects but that lack hemolytic activity can be proposed. The findings highlight the importance of peptide amphipathicity and allow a rational method that can be used to dissociate the antimicrobial and hemolytic effects of cationic peptides, which have potent antimicrobial properties, to be proposed.},

Essentially, a RBH is found when the proteins encoded by two genes, each in a different genome, find each other as the best scoring match in the other genome. NCBI's BLAST is the software most usually used for the sequence comparisons necessary to finding RBHs. Since sequence comparison can be time consuming, we decided to compare the number and quality of RBHs detected using algorithms that run in a fraction of the time as BLAST. We tested BLAT, LAST and UBLAST. All three programs ran in a hundredth to a 25th of the time required to run BLAST. A reduction in the number of homologs and RBHs found by the faster algorithms compared to BLAST becomes apparent as the genomes compared become more dissimilar, with BLAT, a program optimized for quickly finding very similar sequences, missing both the most homologs and the most RBHs. Though LAST produced the closest number of homologs and RBH to those produced with BLAST, UBLAST was very close, with either program producing between 0.6 and 0.8 of the RBHs as BLAST between dissimilar genomes, while in more similar genomes the differences were barely apparent. UBLAST ran faster than LAST, making it the best option among the programs tested.},

abstract = {Multistability, the capacity to achieve multiple internal states in response to a single set of external inputs, is the defining characteristic of a switch. Biological switches are essential for the determination of cell fate in multicellular organisms, the regulation of cell-cycle oscillations during mitosis and the maintenance of epigenetic traits in microbes. The multistability of several natural and synthetic systems has been attributed to positive feedback loops in their regulatory networks. However, feedback alone does not guarantee multistability. The phase diagram of a multistable system, a concise description of internal states as key parameters are varied, reveals the conditions required to produce a functional switch. Here we present the phase diagram of the bistable lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli. We use this phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, to quantitatively investigate processes such as sugar uptake and transcriptional regulation in vivo. We then show how the hysteretic response of the wild-type system can be converted to an ultrasensitive graded response. The phase diagram thus serves as a sensitive probe of molecular interactions and as a powerful tool for rational network design.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the publication of the first draft of the human genome in 2000, bioinformatic data have been accumulating at an overwhelming pace. Currently, more than 3 million sequences and 35 thousand structures of proteins and nucleic acids are available in public databases. Finding correlations in and between these data to answer critical research questions is extremely challenging. This problem needs to be approached from several directions: information science to organize and search the data; information visualization to assist in recognizing correlations; mathematics to formulate statistical inferences; and biology to analyze chemical and physical properties in terms of sequence and structure changes. RESULTS: Here we present MultiSeq, a unified bioinformatics analysis environment that allows one to organize, display, align and analyze both sequence and structure data for proteins and nucleic acids. While special emphasis is placed on analyzing the data within the framework of evolutionary biology, the environment is also flexible enough to accommodate other usage patterns. The evolutionary approach is supported by the use of predefined metadata, adherence to standard ontological mappings, and the ability for the user to adjust these classifications using an electronic notebook. MultiSeq contains a new algorithm to generate complete evolutionary profiles that represent the topology of the molecular phylogenetic tree of a homologous group of distantly related proteins. The method, based on the multidimensional QR factorization of multiple sequence and structure alignments, removes redundancy from the alignments and orders the protein sequences by increasing linear dependence, resulting in the identification of a minimal basis set of sequences that spans the evolutionary space of the homologous group of proteins. CONCLUSION: MultiSeq is a major extension of the Multiple Alignment tool that is provided as part of VMD, a structural visualization program for analyzing molecular dynamics simulations. Both are freely distributed by the NIH Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics and MultiSeq is included with VMD starting with version 1.8.5.

abstract = {In protein structure prediction, a considerable number of alternative models are usually produced from which subsequently the final model has to be selected. Thus, a scoring function for the identification of the best model within an ensemble of alternative models is a key component of most protein structure prediction pipelines. QMEAN, which stands for Qualitative Model Energy ANalysis, is a composite scoring function describing the major geometrical aspects of protein structures. Five different structural descriptors are used. The local geometry is analyzed by a new kind of torsion angle potential over three consecutive amino acids. A secondary structure-specific distance-dependent pairwise residue-level potential is used to assess long-range interactions. A solvation potential describes the burial status of the residues. Two simple terms describing the agreement of predicted and calculated secondary structure and solvent accessibility, respectively, are also included. A variety of different implementations are investigated and several approaches to combine and optimize them are discussed. QMEAN was tested on several standard decoy sets including a molecular dynamics simulation decoy set as well as on a comprehensive data set of totally 22,420 models from server predictions for the 95 targets of CASP7. In a comparison to five well-established model quality assessment programs, QMEAN shows a statistically significant improvement over nearly all quality measures describing the ability of the scoring function to identify the native structure and to discriminate good from bad models. The three-residue torsion angle potential turned out to be very effective in recognizing the native fold.},

abstract = {The Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM), an extension of Ferrenberg and Swendsen's Multiple Histogram Technique, has been applied for the first time on complex biomolecular Hamiltonians. The method is presented here as an extension of the Umbrella Sampling method for free-energy and Potential of Mean Force calculations. This algorithm possesses the following advantages over methods that are currently employed: (1) It provides a built-in estimate of sampling errors thereby yielding objective estimates of the optimal location and length of additional simulations needed to achieve a desired level of precision; (2) it yields the “best” value of free energies by taking into account all the simulations so as to minimize the statistical errors; (3) in addition to optimizing the links between simulations, it also allows multiple overlaps of probability distributions for obtaining better estimates of the free-energy differences. By recasting the Ferrenberg–Swendsen Multiple Histogram equations in a form suitable for molecular mechanics type Hamiltonians, we have demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of this method by applying it to a test problem of the generation of the Potential of Mean Force profile of the pseudorotation phase angle of the sugar ring in deoxyadenosine. {\textcopyright} 1992 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) are defense proteins in a number of higher-plant species that are directly targeted toward herbivores. Jatropha curcas is one of the biodiesel plants having RIPs. The Jatropha seed meal, after extraction of oil, is rich in curcin, a highly toxic RIP similar to ricin, which makes it unsuitable for animal feed. Although the toxicity of curcin is well documented in the literature, the detailed toxic properties and the 3D structure of curcin has not been determined by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy or any in silico techniques to date. In this pursuit, the structure of curcin was modeled by a composite approach of 3D structure prediction using threading and ab initio modeling. Assessment of model quality was assessed by methods which include Ramachandran plot analysis and Qmean score estimation. Further, we applied the protein-ligand docking approach to identify the r-RNA binding residue of curcin. The present work provides the first structural insight into the binding mode of r-RNA adenine to the curcin protein and forms the basis for designing future inhibitors of curcin. Cloning of a future peptide inhibitor within J. curcas can produce non-toxic varieties of J. curcas, which would make the seed-cake suitable as animal feed without curcin detoxification.},

Increasing evidences have elucidated the outcome of inflammatory pathways dysregulation resulting in many symptoms of chronic diseases. The detection of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-$\kappa$B), STAT and their gene products such as COX-2, cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors has laid molecular foundation for the important role of inflammation in chronic diseases in which the NF-$\kappa$B is reported as a major mediator which makes a possible way for the development of new therapeutic approaches using synthetic and natural compounds that might eventually decrease the prevalence of these diseases. Even if many inflammatory markers like TNF-$\alpha$, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and C-reactive protein (CRP) are reported to be the major key factors with proved role in several inflammatory diseases, IL-1 and TNF-$\alpha$ are the important cytokines that can induce the expression of NF-$\kappa$B which is the potential target in these inflammatory diseases. This review aims to explore and summarize that how some drugs and natural compounds show their modulatory activity in inflammatory pathways and chronic inflammatory markers in these inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Inflammation and oxidative stress are thought to promote tissue damage in multiple sclerosis. Thus, novel therapeutics enhancing cellular resistance to free radicals could prove useful for multiple sclerosis treatment. BG00012 is an oral formulation of dimethylfumarate. In a phase II multiple sclerosis trial, BG00012 demonstrated beneficial effects on relapse rate and magnetic resonance imaging markers indicative of inflammation as well as axonal destruction. First we have studied effects of dimethylfumarate on the disease course, central nervous system, tissue integrity and the molecular mechanism of action in an animal model of chronic multiple sclerosis: myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in C57BL/6 mice. In the chronic phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, preventive or therapeutic application of dimethylfumarate ameliorated the disease course and improved preservation of myelin, axons and neurons. In vitro, the application of fumarates increased murine neuronal survival and protected human or rodent astrocytes against oxidative stress. Application of dimethylfumarate led to stabilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2, activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2-dependent transcriptional activity and accumulation of NADP(H) quinoline oxidoreductase-1 as a prototypical target gene. Furthermore, the immediate metabolite of dimethylfumarate, monomethylfumarate, leads to direct modification of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, at cysteine residue 151. In turn, increased levels of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 and reduced protein nitrosylation were detected in the central nervous sytem of dimethylfumarate-treated mice. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 was also upregulated in the spinal cord of autopsy specimens from untreated patients with multiple sclerosis. In dimethylfumarate-treated mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, increased immunoreactivity for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 was detected by confocal microscopy in neurons of the motor cortex and the brainstem as well as in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In mice deficient for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 on the same genetic background, the dimethylfumarate mediated beneficial effects on clinical course, axon preservation and astrocyte activation were almost completely abolished thus proving the functional relevance of this transcription factor for the neuroprotective mechanism of action. We conclude that the ability of dimethylfumarate to activate nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 may offer a novel cytoprotective modality that further augments the natural antioxidant responses in multiple sclerosis tissue and is not yet targeted by other multiple sclerosis therapies.},

abstract = {High-throughput technologies for DNA sequencing and for analyses of transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes have provided the foundations for deciphering the structure, variation and function of the human genome and relating them to health and disease states. The increased efficiency of DNA sequencing opens up the possibility of analyzing a large number of individual genomes and transcriptomes, and complete reference proteomes and metabolomes are within reach using powerful analytical techniques based on chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Computational and mathematical tools have enabled the development of systems approaches for deciphering the functional and regulatory networks underlying the behavior of complex biological systems. Further conceptual and methodological developments of these tools are needed for the integration of various data types across the multiple levels of organization and time frames that are characteristic of human development, physiology and disease. Medical genomics has attempted to overcome the initial limitations of genome-wide association studies and has identified a limited number of susceptibility loci for many complex and common diseases. Iterative systems approaches are starting to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of human diseases, and to facilitate the development of better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cancer and many other diseases. Systems approaches will transform the way drugs are developed through academy-industry partnerships that will target multiple components of networks and pathways perturbed in diseases. They will enable medicine to become predictive, personalized, preventive and participatory, and, in the process, concepts and methods from Western and oriental cultures can be combined. We recommend that systems medicine should be developed through an international network of systems biology and medicine centers dedicated to inter-disciplinary training and education, to help reduce the gap in healthcare between developed and developing countries.},

In addition, progesterone has well-described protective effects against numerous insults in a variety of cell models, animal models and in humans. While ongoing research in several laboratories continues to shed light on the mechanism(s) by which progesterone and its related progestins exert their effects in the CNS, our understanding is still incomplete. Among the key mediators of progesterone's beneficial effects is the family of growth factors called neurotrophins. Here, we review the mechanisms by which progesterone regulates one important member of the neurotrophin family, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and provides support for its pivotal role in the protective program elicited by progesterone in the brain. ?? 2012 IBRO.},

A battery of proteomics approaches is now being employed for the analysis of protein expression levels, the monitoring of cellular activities and for gaining an increased understanding into biochemical pathways. Combined, these approaches are changing the way we study disease by allowing accurate and targeted, large scale protein analysis, which will provide invaluable insight into disease pathogenesis. Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), prion disease, and other diseases that affect the neuromuscular system, are a leading cause of disability in the aging population. There are no effective intervention strategies for these disorders and diagnosis is challenging as it relies primarily on clinical symptomatic features, which often overlap at early stages of disease. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop reliable biomarkers to improve early and specific diagnosis, to track disease progression, to measure molecular responses towards treatment regimes and ultimately devise new therapeutic strategies. To accomplish this, a better understanding of disease mechanisms is needed. In this review we summarize recent advances in the field of proteomics applicable to neurodegenerative disorders, and how these advances are fueling our understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of these complex disorders.},

abstract = {Background:Key challenges of biopsy-based determination of prostate cancer aggressiveness include tumour heterogeneity, biopsy-sampling error, and variations in biopsy interpretation. The resulting uncertainty in risk assessment leads to significant overtreatment, with associated costs and morbidity. We developed a performance-based strategy to identify protein biomarkers predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness and lethality regardless of biopsy-sampling variation.Methods:Prostatectomy samples from a large patient cohort with long follow-up were blindly assessed by expert pathologists who identified the tissue regions with the highest and lowest Gleason grade from each patient. To simulate biopsy-sampling error, a core from a high- and a low-Gleason area from each patient sample was used to generate a 'high' and a 'low' tumour microarray, respectively.Results:Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we identified from 160 candidates 12 biomarkers that predicted prostate cancer aggressiveness (surgical Gleason and TNM stage) and lethal outcome robustly in both high- and low-Gleason areas. Conversely, a previously reported lethal outcome-predictive marker signature for prostatectomy tissue was unable to perform under circumstances of maximal sampling error.Conclusions:Our results have important implications for cancer biomarker discovery in general and development of a sampling error-resistant clinical biopsy test for prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 17 July 2014; doi:10.1038/bjc.2014.396 www.bjcancer.com.},

abstract = {Brain damage induced by blunt head trauma is multifactorial in that the initial injury both induces extensive depolarization and damages tissue through transient sheer forces that mechanically deform tissue components, especially axons and microvessels. Furthermore, although there is little evidence for initial energy depletion, subsequent tissue edema and microvascular perfusion shunting may result in areas of focal ischemia. This review suggests that these events lead to a final common pathway of neuronal death that involves loss of cellular calcium homeostasis, production of injurious free radicals, and tissue acidosis.},

abstract = {Neuroinflammation occuring after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex phenomenon comprising distinct cellular and molecular events involving the injured as well as the healthy cerebral tissue. Although immunoactivation only represents a one of the many cascades initiated in the pathophysiology of TBI, the exact function of each mediator, activated cell types or pathophysiological mechanism, needs to be further elucidated. It is widely accepted that inflammatory events display dual and opposing roles promoting, on the one hand, the repair of the injured tissue and, on the other hand, causing additional brain damage mediated by the numerous neurotoxic substances released. Most of the data supporting these hypotheses derive from experimental work based on both animal models and cultured neuronal cells. More recently, evidence has been provided that a complete elimination of selected inflammatory mediators is rather detrimental as shown by the attenuation of neurological recovery. However, there are conflicting results reported on this issue which strongly depend on the experimental setting used. The history of immunoactivation in neurotrauma is the subject of this review article, giving particular emphasis to the comparison of clinical versus experimental studies performed over the last 10 years. These results also are evaluated with respect to other neuropathologies, which are years ahead as compared to the research in TBI. The possible reciprocal influence of peripheral and intrathecal activation of the immune system will also be discussed. To conclude, the future directions of research in the field of neurotrauma is considered.},

These PEST regions are generally, but not always, flanked by clusters containing several positively charged amino acids. Similar inspection of 35 proteins with intracellular half-lives between 20 and 220 hours revealed that only three contain a PEST region. On the basis of this information, it was anticipated that caseins, which contain several PEST sequences, would be rapidly degraded within eukaryotic cells. This expectation was confirmed by red blood cell-mediated microinjection of 125I-labeled caseins into HeLa cells where they exhibited half-lives of less than 2 hours. The rapid degradation of injected alpha- and beta-casein as well as the inverse correlation of PEST regions with intracellular stability indicate that the presence of these regions can result in the rapid intracellular degradation of the proteins containing them.},

abstract = {PHD fingers represent one of the largest families of epigenetic readers capable of decoding post-translationally modified or unmodified histone H3 tails. Because of their direct involvement in human pathologies they are increasingly considered as a potential therapeutic target. Several PHD/histone-peptide structures have been determined, however relatively little information is available on their dynamics. Studies aiming to characterize the dynamic and energetic determinants driving histone peptide recognition by epigenetic readers would strongly benefit from computational studies. Herein we focus on the dynamic and energetic characterization of the PHD finger subclass specialized in the recognition of histone H3 peptides unmodified in position K4 (H3K4me0). As a case study we focused on the first PHD finger of autoimmune regulator protein (AIRE-PHD1) in complex with H3K4me0. PCA analysis of the covariance matrix of free AIRE-PHD1 highlights the presence of a "flapping" movement, which is blocked in an open conformation upon binding to H3K4me0. Moreover, binding free energy calculations obtained through Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) methodology are in good qualitative agreement with experiments and allow dissection of the energetic terms associated with native and alanine mutants of AIRE-PHD1/H3K4me0 complexes. MM/PBSA calculations have also been applied to the energetic analysis of other PHD fingers recognizing H3K4me0. In this case we observe excellent correlation between computed and experimental binding free energies. Overall calculations show that H3K4me0 recognition by PHD fingers relies on compensation of the electrostatic and polar solvation energy terms and is stabilized by non-polar interactions.},

abstract = {GMXPBSA 2.0 is a user-friendly suite of Bash/Perl scripts for streamlining MM/PBSA calculations on structural ensembles derived from GROMACS trajectories, to automatically calculate binding free energies for protein-protein or ligand-protein complexes. GMXPBSA 2.0 is flexible and can easily be customized to specific needs. Additionally, it performs computational alanine scanning (CAS) to study the effects of ligand and/or receptor alanine mutations on the free energy of binding. Calculations require only for protein-protein or protein-ligand MD simulations. GMXPBSA 2.0 performs different comparative analysis, including a posteriori generation of alanine mutants of the wild-type complex, calculation of the binding free energy values of the mutant complexes and comparison of the results with the wild-type system. Moreover, it compares the binding free energy of different complexes trajectories, allowing the study the effects of non-alanine mutations, post-translational modifications or unnatural amino acids on the binding free energy of the system under investigation. Finally, it can calculate and rank relative affinity to the same receptor utilizing MD simulations of proteins in complex with different ligands. In order to dissect the different MM/PBSA energy contributions, including molecular mechanic (MM), electrostatic contribution to solvation (PB) and nonpolar contribution to solvation (SA), the tool combines two freely available programs: the MD simulations software GROMACS and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation solver APBS. All the calculations can be performed in single or distributed automatic fashion on a cluster facility in order to increase the calculation by dividing frames across the available processors.

External routines: APBS (http://www.Poissonboltzmann.org/apbs/) and GROMACS installations (http://www.gromacs.org). Optionally LaTeX. Nature of problem:. Calculates the Molecular Mechanics (MM) data (Lennard-Jones and Coulomb terms) and the solvation energy terms (polar and nonpolar terms respectively) from an ensemble of structures derived from GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation trajectory. These calculations are performed for each single component of the simulated complex, including protein and ligand. In order to cancel out artefacts an identical grid setup for each component, including complex, protein and ligand, is required. Performs statistical analysis on the extracted data and comparison with wild-type complex in case of either computational alanine scanning or calculations on a set of simulations. Evaluates possible outliers in the frames extracted from the simulations during the binding free energy calculations. Solution method:. The tool combines the freely available programs GROMACS and APBS to: 1. extract frames from a single or multiple complex molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, allowing comparison between multiple trajectories; 2. split the complex frames in the single components including complex, protein and ligand; 3. calculate the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb energy values (MM terms); 4. calculate the polar solvation energy values using the implicit solvation Poisson-Boltzmann model (PB); 5. calculate the nonpolar solvation energy value based on the solvent accessible surface area (SASA); 6. combine all the calculated terms into the final binding free energy value; 7. repeat the same procedure from point 1 to 6 for each simulation in case of computational alanine scanning (CAS) or simultaneous comparison of different MDs. Restrictions:. Input format files compatible with GROMACS engine 4.5 and later versions. Availability of the force field or of the topology files. Running time:. On a single core, Lennard-Jones, Coulomb and nonpolar solvation terms calculations require a few minutes. The time required for polar solvation terms calculations depends on the system size. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In recent years, patterns of injury have been changing, with more injuries, particularly contusions, occurring in older patients. Blast injuries have been identified as a novel entity with specific characteristics. Traditional approaches to the classification of clinical severity are the subject of debate owing to the widespread policy of early sedation and ventilation in more severely injured patients, and are being supplemented with structural and functional neuroimaging. Basic science research has greatly advanced our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in secondary damage, creating opportunities for medical intervention and targeted therapies; however, translating this research into patient benefit remains a challenge. Clinical management has become much more structured and evidence based since the publication of guidelines covering many aspects of care.

DESIGN: Records were reviewed on 946 persons aged 5 to 21 years who had sustained TBI. All were patients who subsequently received disability services in California, 1987 to 1995. RESULTS: The chief predictors of mortality were basic functional skills such as mobility and self-feeding. After the initial high-risk period, mortality risk for TBI was much lower than for similarly functioning persons with cerebral palsy (a comparison group), although after 10 years the two sets of mortality rates had largely converged. For high-functioning persons, life expectancies were only 3 to 5 years shorter than for the general population. By contrast, the remaining life expectancy for those without mobility 6 months after injury was only 15 years.},

For adults, cognitive deficits and symptoms are common in the acute stage, and the majority of studies report recovery for most within 3-12 months. Where symptoms persist, compensation/litigation is a factor, but there is little consistent evidence for other predictors. The literature on this area is of varying quality and causal inferences are often mistakenly drawn from cross-sectional studies.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of representative mesophilic and psycrophilic elastases have been carried out at different temperatures to explore the molecular basis of cold adaptation inside a specific enzymatic family. The molecular dynamics trajectories have been compared and analyzed in terms of secondary structure, molecular flexibility, intramolecular and protein-solvent interactions, unravelling molecular features relevant to rationalize the efficient catalytic activity of psychrophilic elastases at low temperature. The comparative molecular dynamics investigation reveals that modulation of the number of protein-solvent interactions is not the evolutionary strategy followed by the psycrophilic elastase to enhance catalytic activity at low temperature. In addition, flexibility and solvent accessibility of the residues forming the catalytic triad and the specificity pocket are comparable in the cold- and warm-adapted enzymes. Instead, loop regions with different amino acid composition in the two enzymes, and clustered around the active site or the specificity pocket, are characterized by enhanced flexibility in the cold-adapted enzyme. Remarkably, the psycrophilic elastase is characterized by reduced flexibility, when compared to the mesophilic counterpart, in some scattered regions distant from the functional sites, in agreement with hypothesis suggesting that local rigidity in regions far from functional sites can be beneficial for the catalytic activity of psychrophilic enzymes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO; EC 1.3.3.4) is an essential enzyme catalyzing the last common step in the pathway leading to heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Great interest in PPO inhibitors arises from both its significance to agriculture and medicine. However, the discovery of PPO inhibitors with ultrahigh potency and selectivity is hampered due to lack of structural and mechanistic understanding about the substrate recognition, which remains a longstanding question central in porphyrin biology. To understand the mechanism, a novel binding model of protogen (protoporphyrinogen IX, the substrate) was developed through extensive computational simulations. Subsequently, amino acid residues that are critical for protogen binding identified by computational simulations were substituted by mutagenesis. Kinetic analyses of these mutants indicated that these residues were critical for protogen binding. In addition, the calculated free energies of protogen binding with these mutants correlated well with the experimental data, indicating the reasonability of the binding model. On the basis of this novel model, the fundamental mechanism of substrate recognition was investigated by performing potential of mean force (PMF) calculations, which provided an atomic level description of conformational changes and pathway intermediates. The free energy profile revealed a feedback inhibition mechanism of proto (protoporphyrin IX, the product), which was also in agreement with experimental evidence. The novel mechanistic insights obtained from this study present a new starting point for future rational design of more efficient PPO inhibitors based on the product-bound PPO structure.},

Miltirone, another abietane type-diterpene quinone isolated from Danshen, has been reported for its anti-oxidative, anxiolytic and anti-cancer effects. The aim of this study was to study the effect of miltirone on the metabolism of model probe substrates of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4 in pooled human liver microsomes. Miltirone showed moderate inhibition on CYP1A2 (IC50 = 1.73 $\mu$M) and CYP2C9 (IC50 = 8.61 $\mu$M), and weak inhibition on CYP2D6 (IC50 = 30.20 $\mu$M) and CYP3A4 (IC50 = 33.88 $\mu$M). Enzyme kinetic studies showed that miltirone competitively inhibited CYP2C9 (Ki = 1.48 $\mu$M), and displayed mixed type inhibitions on CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 with Ki values of 3.17 $\mu$M, 24.25 $\mu$M and 35.09 $\mu$M, respectively. Molecular docking study further confirmed the ligand-binding conformations of miltirone in the active sites of these human CYP450 isoforms, and provided some information on structure-activity relationships for the CYPs inhibition by tanshinones.

abstract = {3D models of CYP2E1 were constructed for the purpose of structure-based prediction of 2E1 metabolism of diverse substrates based on configuration sampling of ligand-atom-oxyferryl center distances and quantum chemical criteria. Models were constructed on the basis of sequence alignments of 2E1 with templates of known structure, including rabbit CYP2C5 (3LVdH) and bacterial CYP450s. Following geometric and energetic assessments, the utility of the model was tested in structure-based predictions of metabolism. Autodock was used to dock chlorzoxazone, p-nitrophenol, N-nitrosodimethylamine, acetominophen, caffeine, theophylline, and methoxyflurane into the model CYP2E1 employing a model oxyferryl heme with charges based on density functional theoretical parametrization. In all cases, the lowest energy bound docked configurations corresponded to ones with the substrate intimately associated with the oxyferryl center. Configurations among the lowest energy docked forms of each of the ligands had orientations relative to the oxyferryl center consistent with the experimentally observed metabolites. Docking of long-chain dialkylnitrosoamines revealed no heme binding site bound configurations, in agreement with the negligible metabolism of these ligands. The lowest energy docked configurations of chlorzoxazone, p-nitrophenol, and N-nitrosodimethylamine, high-affinity substrates of 2E1, were used to initiate 300 ps molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. The MD-sampled ligand-oxyferryl heme reactant configurations were in good accord with density functional theoretical (DFT) optimized oxyferryl-heme-ligand geometries. Analysis of the MD-sampled ligand-2E1 configurations from multiple docked orientations indicates the configurations with closest exposure of reactive centers to the oxyferryl heme to be correlated with observed metabolites with proper consideration of H-abstraction energetics. DFT assessment of relative radical energetics is directly compared with differential H-abstraction activation energetics by compound I and by a p-nitrosophenoxy radical compound I surrogate for the specific case of methoxyflurane and is shown to be in good agreement.},

abstract = {Although the tremendous catalytic power of enzymes is widely recognized, their exact mechanisms of action are still a source of debate. In order to elucidate the origin of their power, it is necessary to look at individual residues and atoms, and establish their contribution to ligand binding, activation, and reaction. Given the present limitations of experimental techniques, only computational tools allow for such detailed analysis. During my PhD studies I have applied a variety of computational methods, reviewed in Chapter 2, to the study of two enzymes: DfrB dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and methyltetrahydrofolate: corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase (MeTr). The DfrB enzyme has intrigued microbiologists since it was discovered thirty years ago, because of its simple structure, enzymatic inefficiency, and its insensitivity to trimethoprim. This bacterial enzyme shows neither structural nor sequence similarity with its chromosomal counterpart, despite both catalysing the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) using NADPH as a cofactor. As numerous attempts to obtain experimental structures of an enzyme ternary complex have been unsuccessful, I combined docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations to produce a reliable model of the reactive DfrB•DHF•NADPH complex. These results, combined with published empirical data, showed that multiple binding modes of the ligands are possible within DfrB. Comprehensive sequence and structural analysis provided further insight into the DfrB family. The presence of the dfrB genes within integrons and their level of sequence conservation suggest that they are old structures that had been diverging well before the introduction of trimethoprim. Each monomer of the tetrameric active enzyme presents an SH3-fold domain; this is a eukaryotic auxiliary domain never found before as the sole domain of a protein, let alone as the catalytic one. Overall, DfrB DHFR seems to be a poorly adapted catalyst, a ‘minimalistic' enzyme that promotes the reaction by facilitating the approach of the ligands rather than by using specific catalytic residues. MeTr initiates the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of anaerobic CO2 fixation. It catalyses the transfer of the N5-methyl group from N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3THF) to the cobalt centre of a corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein. For the reaction to occur, the N5 position of CH3THF is expected to be activated by protonation. As experimental studies have led to conflicting suggestions, computational approaches were used to address the activation mechanism. Initially, I tested the accuracy of quantum mechanical (QM) methods to predict protonation positions and pKas of pterin, folate, and their analogues. Then, different protonation states of CH3THF and active-site aspartic residues were analysed. Fragment QM calculations suggested that the pKa of N5 in CH3THF is likely to increase upon protein binding. Further, ONIOM calculations which accounted for the complete protein structure indicated that active-site aspartic residues are likely to be protonated before the ligand. Finally, solvation and binding free energies of several protonated forms of CH3THF were compared using the thermodynamic integration approach. Taken together, these preliminary results suggest that further work with particular emphasis on the protonation state of active-site aspartic residues is needed in order to elucidate the protonation and activation mechanism of CH3THF within MeTr.},

We find that the computational tools are sufficiently reliable both for identifying substrate binding modes and for distinguishing between different possible reaction mechanisms. It is found that the favored pathway only involves direct participation by the catalytic aspartate, with the neighboring histidine providing critical stabilization (by a factor of approximately 10000) along the reaction. The calculated catalytic rate constant of about 0.1 s(-1) for a hexapeptide substrate derived from the alpha chain of human hemoglobin is in excellent agreement with experimental kinetic data for a similar peptide fragment.},

The ethanolic extract of crude Danshen (6.25-100 $\mu$g/ml) decreased dextromethorphan O-demethylation in vitro (IC 50 = 23.3 $\mu$g/ml) and the water extract of crude Danshen (0.0625-1 mg/ml) showed no inhibition. A commercially available Danshen pill (31.25-500 $\mu$g/ml) also decreased CYP2D6 activity (IC 50 = 265.8 $\mu$g/ml). Among the tanshinones, only dihydrotanshinone significantly inhibited CYP2D6 activity (IC 50 = 35.4 $\mu$M), compared to quinidine, a specific CYP2D6 inhibitor (IC 50 = 0.9 $\mu$M). Crytotanshinone, tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA produced weak inhibition, with IC 20 of 40.8 $\mu$M, 16.5 $\mu$M and 61.4 $\mu$M, respectively. Water soluble components such as salvianolic acid B and danshensu did not affect CYP2D6-mediated metabolism. Enzyme kinetics studies showed that inhibition of CYP2D6 activity by the ethanolic extract of crude Danshen and dihydrotanshinone was concentration-dependent, with K i values of 4.23 $\mu$g/ml and 2.53 $\mu$M, respectively, compared to quinidine, K i = 0.41 $\mu$M. Molecular docking study confirmed that dihydrotanshinone and tanshinone I interacted with the Phe120 amino acid residue in the active cavity of CYP2D6 through Pi-Pi interaction, but did not interact with Glu216 and Asp301, the key residues for substrate binding. The logarithm of free binding energy of dihydrotanshinone (-7.6 kcal/mol) to Phe120 was comparable to quinidine (-7.0 kcal/mol) but greater than tanshinone I (-5.4 kcal/mol), indicating dihydrotanshinone has similar affinity to quinidine in binding to the catalytic site on CYP2D6. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

When proteins are unrelated to others of known activity, bioinformatics inference for function becomes problematic. It would thus be useful to interrogate protein structures for function directly. Here, we predict the function of an enzyme of unknown activity, Tm0936 from Thermotoga maritima, by docking high-energy intermediate forms of thousands of candidate metabolites. The docking hit list was dominated by adenine analogues, which appeared to undergo C6-deamination. Four of these, including 5-methylthioadenosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), were tested as substrates, and three had substantial catalytic rate constants (10(5) M(-1 )s(-1)). The X-ray crystal structure of the complex between Tm0936 and the product resulting from the deamination of SAH, S-inosylhomocysteine, was determined, and it corresponded closely to the predicted structure. The deaminated products can be further metabolized by T. maritima in a previously uncharacterized SAH degradation pathway. Structure-based docking with high-energy forms of potential substrates may be a useful tool to annotate enzymes for function.},

abstract = {Enzymes are dynamic entities: both their conformation and catalytic activity fluctuate over time. When such fluctuations are relatively fast, it is not surprising that the classical Michaelis-Menten (MM) relationship between the steady-state enzymatic velocity and the substrate concentration still holds. However, recent single-molecule experiments have shown that this is the case even for an enzyme whose catalytic activity fluctuates on the 10(-4)-10 s range. The purpose of this paper is to examine various scenarios in which slowly fluctuating enzymes would still obey the MM relationship. Specifically, we consider (1) the quasi-static condition (e.g., the conformational fluctuation of the enzyme-substrate complex is much slower than binding, catalysis, and the conformational fluctuations of the free enzyme), (2) the quasi-equilibrium condition (when the substrate dissociation is much faster than catalysis, irrespective of the time scales or amplitudes of conformational fluctuations), and (3) the conformational-equilibrium condition (when the dissociation and catalytic rates depend on the conformational coordinate in the same way). For each of these scenarios, the physical meaning of the apparent Michaelis constant and catalytic rate constant is provided. Finally, as an example, the theoretical analysis of a recent single-molecule enzyme assay is considered in light of the perspectives presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Molecular modeling was addressed to understand different substrate-binding modes and clarify the role of two positively charged residues of the penicillin G acylase active site - $\beta$R263 and $\alpha$R145 - in binding of negatively charged substrates. Although the electrostatic contribution to productive substrate binding was dominated by $\beta$R263 rather than $\alpha$R145, it was found that productive binding was not the only possible mode of substrate placement in the active site. Two extra binding modes - nonproductive and preproductive - were located by means of molecular docking and dynamics with binding affinities comparable with the productive one. A unique feature of nonproductive and preproductive complexes was that the substrate's acyl group did not penetrate the hydrophobic pocket, but occupied a patch on the protein interface spanning from $\beta$R263 to $\alpha$R145. Nonproductive and preproductive complexes competed with each other and productive binding mode, giving rise to increased apparent substrate binding. Preproductive complex revealed an ability to switch to a productive one during molecular dynamics simulations, and conformational plasticity of the penicillin G acylase active site was shown to be crucial for that. Nonproductive binding observed at molecular modeling corresponded well with experimentally observed substrate inhibition in penicillin acylase catalysis. By combining estimated free energies of substrate binding in each mode, and accounting for two possible conformations of the penicillin G acylase active site (closed and open) quantitative agreement with experimentally measured K(M) values was achieved. Calculated near-attack conformation frequencies from corresponding molecular dynamics simulations were in a quantitative correlation with experimental k(cat) values and demonstrated adequate application of molecular modeling methods.},

These properties are most often estimated from the structural properties of a compound with a structural-activity relationship (QSAR) approach. Rapid advances in molecular pharmacology have characterized a number of important proteins that shape the pharmacokinetic profile of a compound. Previous studies have shown that molecular docking, which is capable of analyzing compound-protein interactions, could be applied to make a categorical estimation of a pharmacokinetic property. The present study focused on the binding affinity of human serum albumin (HSA) as an example to show that docking descriptors might also be useful to estimate the exact value of a pharmacokinetic property. A previously reported dataset containing 94 compounds with log K HSA values was analyzed. A support vector regression model based on the docking descriptors was able to approximate the observed log K HSA in the training and validation dataset with an R 2 = 0.79. This accuracy was comparable to known QSAR models based on compound descriptors. In this case study, it was shown that an account of protein flexibility is essential to calculate informative docking descriptors for use in the quantitative estimation of log K HSA. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Although it is rapidly synthesized from glucose in neural tissues the biochemical processes for replenishing the neurotransmitter glutamate after glutamate release involve the glutamate-glutamine cycle. Numerous in vivo(13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) experiments since 1994 by different laboratories have consistently concluded: (1) the glutamate-glutamine cycle is a major metabolic pathway with a flux rate substantially greater than those suggested by early studies of cell cultures and brain slices; (2) the glutamate-glutamine cycle is coupled to a large portion of the total energy demand of brain function. The dual roles of glutamate as the principal neurotransmitter in the CNS and as a key metabolite linking carbon and nitrogen metabolism make it possible to probe glutamate neurotransmitter cycling using MRS by measuring the labeling kinetics of glutamate and glutamine. At the same time, comparing to non-amino acid neurotransmitters, the added complexity makes it more challenging to quantitatively separate neurotransmission events from metabolism. Over the past few years our understanding of the neuronal-astroglial two-compartment metabolic model of the glutamate-glutamine cycle has been greatly advanced. In particular, the importance of isotopic dilution of glutamine in determining the glutamate-glutamine cycling rate using [1-(13)C] or [1,6-(13)C(2)] glucose has been demonstrated and reproduced by different laboratories. In this article, recent developments in the two-compartment modeling of the glutamate-glutamine cycle are reviewed. In particular, the effects of isotopic dilution of glutamine on various labeling strategies for determining the glutamate-glutamine cycling rate are analyzed. Experimental strategies for measuring the glutamate-glutamine cycling flux that are insensitive to isotopic dilution of glutamine are also suggested.},

If performed under conditions that resemble the conditions in vivo, they may also reveal some of the capacities and properties of the same enzymes in vivo; we shall call this the ex vivo approach. The kinetic characterization of purified enzymes has yet a different utility for systems biology, as does the in vivo determination of enzyme activities. All these approaches are different, and it is becoming important that the appropriate approach be used for the intended purpose. Here, we therefore discuss five approaches to the measurement of enzyme activity in terms of the source of the enzyme activity, the identity of the assay medium, and the purpose of the assay. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Enzyme kinetics is a century-old area of biochemical research which is regaining popularity due to its use in systems biology. Computational models of biochemical networks depend on rate laws and kinetic parameter values that describe the behavior of enzymes in the cellular milieu. While there is a considerable body of enzyme kinetic data available from the past several decades, a large number of enzymes of specific organisms were never assayed or were assayed in conditions that are irrelevant to those models. The result is that systems biology projects are having to carry out large numbers of enzyme kinetic assays. This chapter reviews the main methodologies of enzyme kinetic data analysis and proposes using computational modeling software for that purpose.

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a relevant role among the different functions of a cell. Identifying the PPI network of a given organism (interactome) is useful to shed light on the key molecular mechanisms within a biological system. In this work, we show the role of structural features (loops and domains) to comprehend the molecular mechanisms of PPIs. A paradox in protein-protein binding is to explain how the unbound proteins of a binary complex recognize each other among a large population within a cell and how they find their best docking interface in a short timescale. We use interacting and non-interacting protein pairs to classify the structural features that sustain the binding (or non-binding) behavior. Our study indicates that not only the interacting region but also the rest of the protein surface are important for the interaction fate. The interpretation of this classification suggests that the balance between favoring and disfavoring structural features determines if a pair of proteins interacts or not. Our results are in agreement with previous works and support the funnel-like intermolecular energy landscape theory that explains PPIs. We have used these features to score the likelihood of the interaction between two proteins and to develop a method for the prediction of PPIs. We have tested our method on several sets with unbalanced ratios of interactions and non-interactions to simulate real conditions, obtaining accuracies higher than 25{\%} in the most unfavorable circumstances. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Recently, methods for predicting protein interactions using domain information are proposed and preliminary results have demonstrated their feasibility. In this paper, we develop two domain-based statistical models (neural networks and decision trees) for protein interaction predictions. Unlike most of the existing methods which consider only domain pairs (one domain from one protein) and assume that domain-domain interactions are independent of each other, the proposed methods are capable of exploring all possible interactions between domains and make predictions based on all the domains. Compared to maximum-likelihood estimation methods, our experimental results show that the proposed schemes can predict protein-protein interactions with higher specificity and sensitivity, while requiring less computation time. Furthermore, the decision tree-based model can be used to infer the interactions not only between two domains, but among multiple domains as well.},

Particularly, relevant human pathologies such as cancer or viral infections require downregulating apoptosis signaling pathways to progress. As a result, the identification of proteins responsible for these changes is essential for the diagnostics and development of therapeutics. Transferring functional annotation within protein interaction networks has proven useful to identify such proteins, although this is not a trivial task. Here, we used different scoring methods to transfer annotation from 53 well-studied members of the human apoptosis pathways (as known by 2005) to their protein interactors. All scoring methods produced significant predictions (compared to a random negative model), but its number was too large to be useful. Thus, we made a final prediction using specific combinations of scoring methods and compared it to the proteins related to apoptosis signaling pathways during the last 5 years. We propose 273 candidate proteins that may be relevant in apoptosis signaling pathways. Although some of them have known functions consistent with their proposed apoptotsis involvement, the majority have not been annotated yet, leaving room for further experimental studies.

In addition, we postulate that the complexity exerted by HIV-1 can not merely be explained by the large number of protein-protein interactions documented in the literature but, rather, cell-type-specific interactions and post-translational modifications of viral proteins must be taken into account. We use HIV-1 Tat and its influence on viral transcription as an example of cell-type-specific complexity.

Protein-protein interaction mapping projects that follow stringent criteria, coupled with experimental validation in orthogonal systems, provide high-confidence data sets immanently useful for interrogating developmental and disease mechanisms at a system level as well as elucidating individual protein function and interactome network topology. Although far from complete, currently available maps provide insight into how biochemical properties of proteins and protein complexes are integrated into biological systems. Such maps are also a useful resource to predict the function(s) of thousands of genes.},

abstract = {Proteins are the bricks and mortar of cells. The work of proteins is structural and functional, as they are the principal element of the organization of the cell architecture, but they also play a relevant role in its metabolism and regulation. To perform all these functions, proteins need to interact with each other and with other bio-molecules, either to form complexes or to recognize precise targets of their action. For instance, a particular transcription factor may activate one gene or another depending on its interactions with other proteins and not only with DNA. Hence, the ability of a protein to interact with other bio-molecules, and the partners they have at each particular time and location can be crucial to characterize the role of a protein. Proteins rarely act alone; they rather constitute a mingled network of physical interactions or other types of relationships (such as metabolic and regulatory) or signaling cascades. In this context, understanding the function of a protein implies to recognize the members of its neighborhood and to grasp how they associate, both at the systemic and atomic level. The network of physical interactions between the proteins of a system, cell or organism, is defined as the interactome. The purpose of this review is to deepen the description of interactomes at different levels of detail: from the molecular structure of complexes to the global topology of the network of interactions. The approaches and techniques applied experimentally and computationally to attain each level are depicted. The limits of each technique and its integration into a model network, the challenges and actual problems of completeness of an interactome, and the reliability of the interactions are reviewed and summarized. Finally, the application of the current knowledge of protein-protein interactions on modern network medicine and protein function annotation is also explored.},

abstract = {Most genes, proteins and other components carry out their functions within a complex network of interactions and a single molecule can affect a wide range of other cell components. A global, integrative, approach has been developed for several years, including protein-protein interaction networks (interactomes). In this review, we describe the high-throughput methods used to identify new interactions and to build large interaction datasets. The minimum information required for reporting a molecular interaction experiment (MIMIx) has been defined as a standard for storing data in publicly available interaction databases. Several examples of interaction networks from molecular machines (proteasome) or organelles (phagosome, mitochondrion) to whole organisms (viruses, bacteria, yeast, fly, and worm) are given and attempts to cover the entire human interaction network are discussed. The methods used to perform the topological analysis of interaction networks and to extract biological information from them are presented. These investigations have provided clues on protein functions, signalling and metabolic pathways, and physiological processes, unraveled the molecular basis of some diseases (cancer, infectious diseases), and will be very useful to identify new therapeutic targets and for drug discovery. A major challenge is now to integrate data from different sources (interactome, transcriptome, phenome, localization) to switch from static to dynamic interaction networks. The merging of a viral interactome and the human interactome has been used to simulate viral infection, paving the way for future studies aiming at providing molecular basis of human diseases. ?? 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We carried out a comparative quality assessment of current yeast interactome data sets, demonstrating that high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening provides high-quality binary interaction information. Because a large fraction of the yeast binary interactome remains to be mapped, we developed an empirically controlled mapping framework to produce a "second-generation" high-quality, high-throughput Y2H data set covering approximately 20{\%} of all yeast binary interactions. Both Y2H and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) data are of equally high quality but of a fundamentally different and complementary nature, resulting in networks with different topological and biological properties. Compared to co-complex interactome models, this binary map is enriched for transient signaling interactions and intercomplex connections with a highly significant clustering between essential proteins. Rather than correlating with essentiality, protein connectivity correlates with genetic pleiotropy.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK2) regulates cellular signaling via desensitization of GPCRs and by direct interaction with intracellular signaling molecules. We recently described that ischemic brain injury decreases cerebral GRK2 levels. Here we studied the effect of astrocyte GRK2-deficiency on neonatal brain damage in vivo. As astrocytes protect neurons by taking up glutamate via plasma-membrane transporters, we also studied the effect of GRK2 on the localization of the GLutamate ASpartate Transporter (GLAST). Brain damage induced by hypoxia-ischemia was significantly reduced in GFAP-GRK2+/- mice, which have a 60{\%} reduction in astrocyte GRK2 compared to GFAP-WT littermates. In addition, GRK2-deficient astrocytes have higher plasma-membrane levels of GLAST and an increased capacity to take up glutamate in vitro. In search for the mechanism by which GRK2 regulates GLAST expression, we observed increased GFAP levels in GRK2-deficient astrocytes. GFAP and the cytoskeletal protein ezrin are known regulators of GLAST localization. In line with this evidence, GRK2-deficiency reduced phosphorylation of the GRK2 substrate ezrin and enforced plasma-membrane GLAST association after stimulation with the group I mGluR-agonist DHPG. When ezrin was silenced, the enhanced plasma-membrane GLAST association in DHPG-exposed GRK2-deficient astrocytes was prevented. In conclusion, we identified a novel role of astrocyte GRK2 in regulating plasma-membrane GLAST localization via an ezrin-dependent route. We demonstrate that the 60{\%} reduction in astrocyte GRK2 protein level that is observed in GFAP-GRK2+/- mice is sufficient to significantly reduce neonatal ischemic brain damage. These findings underline the critical role of GRK2 regulation in astrocytes for dampening the extent of brain damage after ischemia. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Markers of neuroinflammation, including activated microglia and increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, have been observed in the brains and CSF of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Yet the link between anti-inflammatory agents and PD in humans remains uncertain, despite indications that neuroinflammation may contribute to cell death in the PD brain and experimental evidence of anti-inflammatory agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exerting neuroprotective effects in animal models. METHODS: Using a population-based approach, we studied NSAID use among 293 incident idiopathic PD cases and 286 age-, race-, and gender-matched controls from three rural California counties. RESULTS: Our data suggested a decreased risk of PD among regular (≥2 pills/week for at least 1 month) aspirin NSAID users (OR, 0.80; 95{\%} CI, 0.56 to 1.15). A stronger protective effect was observed for regular nonaspirin NSAID users (OR, 0.52; 95{\%} CI, 0.35 to 0.79), particularly those who reported 2 or more years of use (OR, 0.44; 95{\%} CI, 0.26 to 0.74). The aspirin effect estimates differed by gender, showing a protective effect only in women, especially among long term (≥24 months) regular users (OR, 0.51; 95{\%} CI, 0.26 to 1.02). CONCLUSION: Our study contributes to the growing body of literature suggesting a protective role for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in Parkinson disease (PD). Given our results and the biologic plausibility of a neuroprotective function for NSAIDs there is a pressing need for further studies elucidating the protective role such drugs may play in PD. {\textcopyright}2007AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

Ibuprofen was infused to steady-state concentrations both in plasma and brain tissue. Ibuprofen levels in plasma and brain tissue were measured by RP-HPLC after the plasma and the brain samples were purified by protein precipitation and solid phase extraction, respectively. Results indicate that both plasma and brain concentrations reached steady-state within 6 h, and that the brain to plasma ratio of ibuprofen was only 0.02.

The failure of free-radical-scavenging antioxidants in clinical trials pinpoints an urgent need to identify and to block major sources of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases. As a major superoxide-producing enzyme complex in activated phagocytes, phagocyte NADPH oxidase (PHOX) is essential for host defense. However, recent preclinical evidence has underscored a pivotal role of overactivated PHOX in chronic neuroinflammation and progressive neurodegeneration. Deficiency in PHOX subunits mitigates neuronal damage induced by diverse insults/stresses relevant to neurodegenerative diseases. More importantly, suppression of PHOX activity correlates with reduced neuronal impairment in models of neurodegenerative diseases. The discovery of PHOX and non-phagocyte NADPH oxidases in astroglia and neurons further reinforces the crucial role of NADPH oxidases in oxidative stress-mediated chronic neurodegeneration. Thus, proper modulation of NADPH oxidase activity might hold therapeutic potential for currently incurable neurodegenerative diseases.},

Although much recent effort has been put into methods to identify interacting partners, there has been a limited focus on how these interactions compare with those known from three-dimensional (3D) structures. Because comparison of protein interactions often involves considering homologous, but not identical, proteins, a key issue is whether proteins that are homologous to an interacting pair will interact in the same way, or interact at all. Accordingly, we describe a method to test putative interactions on complexes of known 3D structure. Given a 3D complex and alignments of homologues of the interacting proteins, we assess the fit of any possible interacting pair on the complex by using empirical potentials. For studies of interacting protein families that show different specificities, the method provides a ranking of interacting pairs useful for prioritizing experiments. We evaluate the method on interacting families of proteins with multiple complex structures. We then consider the fibroblast growth factor/receptor system and explore the intersection between complexes of known structure and interactions proposed between yeast proteins by methods such as two-hybrids. We provide confirmation for several interactions, in addition to suggesting molecular details of how they occur.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder with dementia in the elderly. The AD brain pathology is characterized by deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles but also (among other aspects) by signs of a chronic inflammatory process. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of developing AD and delays its onset. Classical targets of NSAIDs include cycloxygenase, nuclear factor kappaB, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Modulation of these pathways, all of which have been implicated in AD pathogenesis, could explain the NSAID effect on AD progression. However, recent studies indicate that a subset of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and flurbiprofen may have direct Abeta-lowering properties in cell cultures as well as transgenic models of AD-like amyloidosis. A renewed interest in the old and a discovery of new pharmacological properties of these drugs are providing vital insight for future clinical trials. In this review we will summarize how the combination of traditional (anti-inflammatory) and new (anti-amyloidogenic) properties of some NSAIDs is providing unprecedented opportunities for drug discovery and could potentially result in novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of AD.},

Fibrillar ??-amyloid (A??) stimulation has previously been demonstrated to induce the assembly and activation of the microglial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase leading to superoxide production through a tyrosine kinase-based signaling cascade. Ibuprofen treatment of microglia or monocytes with racemic or S-ibuprofen inhibited A??-stimulated Vav tyrosine phosphorylation, NADPH oxidase assembly, and superoxide production. Interestingly, A??-stimulated Vav phosphorylation was not inhibited by COX inhibitors. These findings suggest that ibuprofen acts independently of cyclooxygenase COX inhibition to disrupt signaling cascades leading to microglial NADPH oxidase (NOX2) activation, preventing oxidative damage and enhancing plaque clearance in the brain. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Ibuprofen is a member of the proprionic acid group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), with the S-enantiomer being more active than the R-enantiomer. It has been shown to display protective effects against neuroinflammation, which is linked to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). While its prophylactic effect on AD has been suggested, a comprehensive understanding of its mechanism of action remains unclear. Using iTRAQ-coupled 2-D LC-MS/MS analysis, we report here the first study of protein profiles of neuroblastoma cells incubated separately with the two enantiomers of ibuprofen. Three types of cellular proteins, including metabolic enzymes, signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins, displayed changes. The changes in the level of a number of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and antioxidant activity in cells incubated with the S-enantiomer were further supported by the real-time PCR analysis as well as the reduced level of reactive oxygen species in cells incubated with the S-enantiomer of ibuprofen. Our findings, therefore, provide the possible mechanism of ibuprofen-induced proteins on AD, and the beneficial effects of ibuprofen in reducing the development of AD.},

To date, these interaction maps have typically been generated under a single condition, even though biological systems undergo differential change that is dependent on environment, tissue type, disease state, development or speciation. Several recent interaction mapping studies have demonstrated the power of differential analysis for elucidating fundamental biological responses, revealing that the architecture of an interactome can be massively re-wired during a cellular or adaptive response. Here, we review the technological developments and experimental designs that have enabled differential network mapping at very large scales and highlight biological insight that has been derived from this type of analysis. We argue that differential network mapping, which allows for the interrogation of previously unexplored interaction spaces, will become a standard mode of network analysis in the future, just as differential gene expression and protein phosphorylation studies are already pervasive in genomic and proteomic analysis.},

abstract = {Prediction of protein-protein interactions at the structural level on the proteome scale is important because it allows prediction of protein function, helps drug discovery and takes steps toward genome-wide structural systems biology. We provide a protocol (termed PRISM, protein interactions by structural matching) for large-scale prediction of protein-protein interactions and assembly of protein complex structures. The method consists of two components: rigid-body structural comparisons of target proteins to known template protein-protein interfaces and flexible refinement using a docking energy function. The PRISM rationale follows our observation that globally different protein structures can interact via similar architectural motifs. PRISM predicts binding residues by using structural similarity and evolutionary conservation of putative binding residue 'hot spots'. Ultimately, PRISM could help to construct cellular pathways and functional, proteome-scale annotation. PRISM is implemented in Python and runs in a UNIX environment. The program accepts Protein Data Bank-formatted protein structures and is available at http://prism.ccbb.ku.edu.tr/prism{\_}protocol/.},

Large efforts have been devoted to increase both resolution and accuracy of the methods, probe into the smallest biomolecules as well as the largest macromolecular machineries, unveil transient complexes along with dynamic interaction processes, and, lately, dissect whole organism interactomes using high-throughput strategies. However, the atomic description of such interactions, rarely reached by large-scale projects in structural biology, remains indispensable to fully understand the subtleties of the recognition process, measure the impact of a mutation or predict the effect of a drug binding to a complex. Mixing even a limited amount of experimental and/or bioinformatic data with modeling methods, such as macromolecular docking, presents a valuable strategy to predict the three-dimensional structures of complexes.

abstract = {Preclinical Safety Pharmacology (PSP) attempts to anticipate adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during early phases of drug discovery by testing compounds in simple, in vitro binding assays (that is, preclinical profiling). The selection of PSP targets is based largely on circumstantial evidence of their contribution to known clinical ADRs, inferred from findings in clinical trials, animal experiments, and molecular studies going back more than forty years. In this work we explore PSP chemical space and its relevance for the prediction of adverse drug reactions. Firstly, in silico (computational) Bayesian models for 70 PSP-related targets were built, which are able to detect 93{\%} of the ligands binding at IC(50) {\textless} or = 10 microM at an overall correct classification rate of about 94{\%}. Secondly, employing the World Drug Index (WDI), a model for adverse drug reactions was built directly based on normalized side-effect annotations in the WDI, which does not require any underlying functional knowledge. This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to predict adverse drug reactions across hundreds of categories from chemical structure alone. On average 90{\%} of the adverse drug reactions observed with known, clinically used compounds were detected, an overall correct classification rate of 92{\%}. Drugs withdrawn from the market (Rapacuronium, Suprofen) were tested in the model and their predicted ADRs align well with known ADRs. The analysis was repeated for acetylsalicylic acid and Benperidol which are still on the market. Importantly, features of the models are interpretable and back-projectable to chemical structure, raising the possibility of rationally engineering out adverse effects. By combining PSP and ADR models new hypotheses linking targets and adverse effects can be proposed and examples for the opioid mu and the muscarinic M2 receptors, as well as for cyclooxygenase-1 are presented. It is hoped that the generation of predictive models for adverse drug reactions is able to help support early SAR to accelerate drug discovery and decrease late stage attrition in drug discovery projects. In addition, models such as the ones presented here can be used for compound profiling in all development stages.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells the stability and function of many proteins are regulated by the addition of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like peptides. This process is dependent upon the sequential action of an E1-activating enzyme, an E2-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ligase. Different combinations of these proteins confer substrate specificity and the form of protein modification. However, combinatorial preferences within ubiquitination networks remain unclear. In this study, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens were combined with true homology modeling methods to generate a high-density map of human E2/E3-RING interactions. These data include 535 experimentally defined novel E2/E3-RING interactions and {\textgreater}1300 E2/E3-RING pairs with more favorable predicted free-energy values than the canonical UBE2L3-CBL complex. The significance of Y2H predictions was assessed by both mutagenesis and functional assays. Significantly, 74/80 ({\textgreater}92{\%}) of Y2H predicted complexes were disrupted by point mutations that inhibit verified E2/E3-RING interactions, and a approximately 93{\%} correlation was observed between Y2H data and the functional activity of E2/E3-RING complexes in vitro. Analysis of the high-density human E2/E3-RING network reveals complex combinatorial interactions and a strong potential for functional redundancy, especially within E2 families that have undergone evolutionary expansion. Finally, a one-step extended human E2/E3-RING network, containing 2644 proteins and 5087 edges, was assembled to provide a resource for future functional investigations.},

However, it is a non-trivial task to understand how a change at the protein structure level eventually affects a cell's behavior. This is because complex information at both the protein and pathway level has to be integrated. Given that the idea of integrating both protein and pathway dynamics to estimate the systemic impact of missense mutations in proteins remains predominantly unexplored, we investigate the practicality of such an approach by formulating mathematical models and comparing them with experimental data to study missense mutations. We present two case studies: (1) interpreting systemic perturbation for mutations within the cell cycle control mechanisms (G2 to mitosis transition) for yeast; (2) phenotypic classification of neuron-related human diseases associated with mutations within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that the application of simplified mathematical models is feasible for understanding the effects of small sequence changes on cellular behavior. Furthermore, we show that the systemic impact of missense mutations can be effectively quantified as a combination of protein stability change and pathway perturbation.},

In this paper we introduce a new computational strategy to determine the genome-wide molecular targets of bioactive compounds in both human and bacterial genomes. Our method is based on the use of a novel algorithm, ligand Enrichment of Network Topological Similarity (ligENTS), to map the chemical universe to its global pharmacological space. ligENTS outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in identifying novel drug-target relationships. Furthermore, we integrate ligENTS with our structural systems biology platform to identify drug repurposing opportunities via target similarity profiling. Using this integrated strategy, we have identified novel P. falciparum targets of drug-like active compounds from the Malaria Box, and suggest that a number of approved drugs may be active against malaria. This study demonstrates the potential of an integrative chemical genomics and structural systems biology approach to drug repurposing.},

Calcium binding induces conformational transitions in calmodulin that make it specifically active to particular target proteins. The precise mechanisms underlying calcium binding to calmodulin are still, however, quite poorly understood. RESULTS: In this study, we adopt a structural systems biology approach and develop a mathematical model to investigate various types of cooperative calcium-calmodulin interactions. We compare the predictions of our analysis with physiological dose-response curves taken from the literature, in order to provide a quantitative comparison of the effects of different mechanisms of cooperativity on calcium-calmodulin interactions. The results of our analysis reduce the gap between current understanding of intracellular calmodulin function at the structural level and physiological calcium-dependent calmodulin target activation experiments. CONCLUSION: Our model predicts that the specificity and selectivity of CaM target regulation is likely to be due to the following factors: variations in the target-specific Ca2+ dissociation and cooperatively effected dissociation constants, and variations in the number of Ca2+ ions required to bind CaM for target activation.},

Although there is a growing recognition that mechanistic relationships from molecular to systems level should be integrated into drug discovery paradigms, relatively few studies have integrated information about heterogeneous networks into computational drug-repositioning candidate discovery platforms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using known disease-gene and drug-target relationships from the KEGG database, we built a weighted disease and drug heterogeneous network. The nodes represent drugs or diseases while the edges represent shared gene, biological process, pathway, phenotype or a combination of these features. We clustered this weighted network to identify modules and then assembled all possible drug-disease pairs (putative drug repositioning candidates) from these modules. We validated our predictions by testing their robustness and evaluated them by their overlap with drug indications that were either reported in published literature or investigated in clinical trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Previous computational approaches for drug repositioning focused either on drug-drug and disease-disease similarity approaches whereas we have taken a more holistic approach by considering drug-disease relationships also. Further, we considered not only gene but also other features to build the disease drug networks. Despite the relative simplicity of our approach, based on the robustness analyses and the overlap of some of our predictions with drug indications that are under investigation, we believe our approach could complement the current computational approaches for drug repositioning candidate discovery.},

abstract = {Cell cycle control is highly regulated to guarantee the precise timing of events essential for cell growth, i.e., DNA replication onset and cell division. Failure of this control plays a role in cancer and molecules called cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors (Ckis) exploit a critical function in cell cycle timing. Here we present a multiscale modeling where experimental and computational studies have been employed to investigate structure, function and temporal dynamics of the Cki Sic1 that regulates cell cycle progression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Structural analyses reveal molecular details of the interaction between Sic1 and Cdk/cyclin complexes, and biochemical investigation reveals Sic1 function in analogy to its human counterpart p27(Kip1), whose deregulation leads to failure in timing of kinase activation and, therefore, to cancer. Following these findings, a bottom-up systems biology approach has been developed to characterize modular networks addressing Sic1 regulatory function. Through complementary experimentation and modeling, we suggest a mechanism that underlies Sic1 function in controlling temporal waves of cyclins to ensure correct timing of the phase-specific Cdk activities.},

In this article, we review some recent advances in the structural annotation of cell networks and discuss their potential impact on some of the hottest areas of drug development. In particular, we analyze recent structure-based strategies to target networks, protein interaction interfaces and allosteric sites, and how they will help in the development of more potent and specific treatments. Finally, we propose that mapping genetic variations onto protein networks, beyond the pharmacological targets, can rationalize interindividual variability in drug response, giving valuable hints to advance toward personalized medicine. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The traditional de novo drug discovery is known as a high cost and high risk process. In response, recently there is an increasing interest in discovering new indications for known drugs - a process known as drug repositioning - using computational methods. In this study, we present a new systematic approach for identifying potential new indications of an existing drug through its relation to similar drugs. Different from the previous similarity-based methods, we adapted a novel bipartite-graph based method when considering common drug targets and their interaction information. Furthermore, we added drug structure information into the calculation of drug pairwise similarity. In cross-validation experiments, our method achieved a sensitivity of 0.77 and specificity of 0.92 (AUC = 0.888) and compared favorably to the state of the art. When compared with a control group of drug uses, our drug repositioning results were found to be significantly enriched in both the biomedicai literature and clinical trials. Our results indicate that combining chemical structure and drug target information results in better prediction performance and that the proposed approach successfully captures the implicit information between drug targets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data from high-throughput experiments of protein-protein interactions are commonly used to probe the nature of biological organization and extract functional relationships between sets of proteins. What has not been appreciated is that the underlying mechanisms involved in assembling these networks may exhibit considerable probabilistic behaviour. RESULTS: We find that the probability of an interaction between two proteins is generally proportional to the numerical product of their individual interacting partners, or degrees. The degree-weighted behaviour is manifested throughout the protein-protein interaction networks studied here, except for the high-degree, or hub, interaction areas. However, we find that the probabilities of interaction between the hubs are still high. Further evidence is provided by path length analyses, which show that these hubs are separated by very few links. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that protein-protein interaction networks incorporate probabilistic elements that lead to scale-rich hierarchical architectures. These observations seem to be at odds with a biologically-guided organization. One interpretation of the findings is that we are witnessing the ability of proteins to indiscriminately bind rather than the protein-protein interactions that are actually utilized by the cell in biological processes. Therefore, the topological study of a degree-weighted network requires a more refined methodology to extract biological information about pathways, modules, or other inferred relationships among proteins.},

abstract = {X-ray crystallography and NMR can provide detailed structural information of protein-protein complexes, but technical problems make their application challenging in the high-throughput regime. Other methods such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) are more promising for large-scale application, but at the cost of lower resolution, which is a problem that can be solved by complementing SAXS data with theoretical simulations. Here, we propose a novel strategy that combines SAXS data and accurate protein-protein docking simulations. The approach has been benchmarked on a large pool of known structures with synthetic SAXS data, and on three experimental examples. The combined approach (pyDockSAXS) provided a significantly better success rate (43{\%} for the top 10 predictions) than either of the two methods alone. Further analysis of the influence of different docking parameters made it possible to increase the success rates for specific cases, and to define guidelines for improving the data-driven protein-protein docking protocols. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Deciphering the whole network of protein interactions for a given proteome ('interactome') is the goal of many experimental and computational efforts in Systems Biology. Separately the prediction of the structure of protein complexes by docking methods is a well-established scientific area. To date, docking programs have not been used to predict interaction partners. We provide a proof of principle for such an approach. Using a set of protein complexes representing known interactors in their unbound form, we show that a standard docking program can distinguish the true interactors from a background of 922 non-redundant potential interactors. We additionally show that true interactions can be distinguished from non-likely interacting proteins within the same structural family. Our approach may be put in the context of the proposed 'funnel-energy model'; the docking algorithm may not find the native complex, but it distinguishes binding partners because of the higher probability of favourable models compared with a collection of non-binders. The potential exists to develop this proof of principle into new approaches for predicting interaction partners and reconstructing biological networks.},

Biological switches are essential for the determination of cell fate in multicellular organisms, the regulation of cell-cycle oscillations during mitosis and the maintenance of epigenetic traits in microbes. The multistability of several natural and synthetic systems has been attributed to positive feedback loops in their regulatory networks. However, feedback alone does not guarantee multistability. The phase diagram of a multistable system, a concise description of internal states as key parameters are varied, reveals the conditions required to produce a functional switch. Here we present the phase diagram of the bistable lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli. We use this phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, to quantitatively investigate processes such as sugar uptake and transcriptional regulation in vivo. We then show how the hysteretic response of the wild-type system can be converted to an ultrasensitive graded response. The phase diagram thus serves as a sensitive probe of molecular interactions and as a powerful tool for rational network design.},

Among the various patterns of regulation associated with non-linear kinetics, multistability, which corresponds to a true switch between alternate steady states, allows a graded signal to be turned into a discontinuous evolution of the system along several possible distinct pathways, which can be either reversible or irreversible. Multistability plays a significant role in some of the basic processes of life. It might account for maintenance of phenotypic differences in the absence of genetic or environmental differences, as has been demonstrated experimentally for the regulation of the lactose operon in Escherichia coli. Cell differentiation might also be explained as multistability.},

Methods: We described here a very effective strategy combining with multiple-docking and protein-ligand binding-affinity fingerprint method to generate bio-functional network and pathway and reveal the protein "unknown" functions and their relationship. Results: Totally 27 sets of proteins and 28 bio-active molecules were used to reconstruct the possible phospholipids metabolic network by computational simulation strategy. The protein-ligand network reconstruction and pathway based drug design showed that the direct interaction investigation might be effective in complex biological system study. Conclusion: Even for weak and moderate interactions in the real biology system, the relationship between each other can be achieved by fingerprint analysis based on multiple-docking data. The results of these calculations give valuable insight into the pathway and the function relationship among these proteins. This method can be a very useful tool for protein classification, target selection, and inhibitor design.},

abstract = {Sirt-1 is defined as a nuclear protein involved in the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and neurodegeneration through the de-acetylation of many different substrates even if experimental data in mouse suggest both its cytoplasmatic presence and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling upon oxidative stress. Since the experimental structure of human Sirt-1 has not yet been reported, we have modeled its 3D structure, highlighted that it is composed by four different structural regions: N-terminal region, allosteric site, catalytic core and C-terminal region, and underlined that the two terminal regions have high intrinsic disorder propensity and numerous putative phosphorylation sites. Many different papers report experimental studies related to its functional activators because Sirt-1 is implicated in various diseases and cancers. The aim of this article is (i) to present interactomic studies based human Sirt-1 to understand its most important functional relationships in the light of the gene-protein interactions that control major metabolic pathways and (ii) to show by docking studies how this protein binds some activator molecules in order to evidence structural determinants, physico-chemical features and those residues involved in the formation of complexes.},

abstract = {Increased availability of bioinformatics resources is creating opportunities for the application of network pharmacology to predict drug effects and toxicity resulting from multi-target interactions. Here we present a high-precision computational prediction approach that combines two elaborately built machine learning systems and multiple molecular docking tools to assess binding potentials of a test compound against proteins involved in a complex molecular network. One of the two machine learning systems is a re-scoring function to evaluate binding modes generated by docking tools. The second is a binding mode selection function to identify the most predictive binding mode. Results from a series of benchmark validations and a case study show that this approach surpasses the prediction reliability of other techniques and that it also identifies either primary or off-targets of kinase inhibitors. Integrating this approach with molecular network maps makes it possible to address drug safety issues by comprehensively investigating network-dependent effects of a drug or drug candidate.},

abstract = {Many thousands of proteins encoded by the genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the causal organism of the deadliest form of human malaria, are of unknown function. It is of utmost importance that these proteins be characterized if we are to develop combative strategies against malaria based on the biology of the parasite. In an attempt to infer protein function on a genome-wide scale, we computationally modeled the P. falciparum interactome, elucidating local and global functional relationships between gene products. The resulting interaction network, reconstructed by integrating in silico and experimental functional genomics data within a Bayesian framework, covers approximately 68{\%} of the parasite genome and provides functional inferences for more than 2000 uncharacterized proteins, based on their associations. Network reconstruction involved the use of a novel strategy, where we incorporated continuously updated, uniform reference priors in our Bayesian model. This method for generating interaction maps is thus also well suited for application to other genomes, where pre-existing interactome knowledge is sparse. Additionally, we superimposed this map on genomes of three apicomplexan pathogens--Plasmodium yoelii, Toxoplasma gondii, and Cryptosporidium parvum--describing relationships between these organisms based on retained functional linkages. This comparison provided a glimpse of the highly evolved nature of P. falciparum; for instance, a deficit of nearly 26{\%} in terms of predicted interactions is observed against P. yoelii, because of missing ortholog partners in pairs of functionally linked proteins.},

abstract = {Metalloprotein is a basic term for a proteins that contains a metal ion cofactor, have many functions in cells, such as enzymes, transport and storage proteins, and signal transduction proteins. The balance between MMPs and TIMPs are critical in extracellular matrix (ECM) development, morphogenesis, tissue repair and remodeling through MAPK Pathway. Excess of MMPs and TIMPs shows adverse effects, leading to aging diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, Cancer, Asthma, Diabetes 2 Mellitus etc. Human Protein Reference Dataset (HPRD) assessed 10 interactions for TIMP1, 5 interactions for TIMP2, 8 interactions for TIMP3 and 2 interactions for TIMP4. The data also assessed 11 interactions for MMP1 and 11 interactions for MMP2. The data from HPRD and Pathwaylinker has also predicted the interaction of Metalloproteins with aging diseases. In the present experimentation, in silico docking models predicted that Iron and Cobalt are activators for TIMPs and MMPs. These metals can serve as an important reactants with good binding affinity for TIMPs and MMPs. Except TIMP1 and TIMP2, all other TIMPs used in present experimentation have good binding affinities with Cyanocobalamin. Hence Cyanocobalamine can be used in treatment of various diseases such as D2M, Cancer, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases in low dose for longer period, in control of MAPK pathway. 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract = {Systems biology has greatly contributed toward the analysis and understanding of biological systems under various genotypic and environmental conditions on a much larger scale than ever before. One of the applications of systems biology can be seen in unraveling and understanding complicated human diseases where the primary causes for a disease are often not clear. The in silico genome-scale metabolic network models can be employed for the analysis of diseases and for the discovery of novel drug targets suitable for treating the disease. Also, new antimicrobial targets can be discovered by analyzing, at the systems level, the genome-scale metabolic network of pathogenic microorganisms. Such applications are possible as these genome-scale metabolic network models contain extensive stoichiometric relationships among the metabolites constituting the organism's metabolism and information on the associated biophysical constraints. In this review, we highlight applications of genome-scale metabolic network modeling and simulations in predicting drug targets and designing potential strategies in combating pathogenic infection. Also, the use of metabolic network models in the systematic analysis of several human diseases is examined. Other computational and experimental approaches are discussed to complement the use of metabolic network models in the analysis of biological systems and to facilitate the drug discovery pipeline.},

However, the structural details of these interactions, often necessary to understand their function, are only available for a tiny fraction, and the experimental difficulties surrounding complex structure determination make computational modeling techniques paramount. In this manuscript, we critically review some of the most recent developments in the field of structural bioinformatics applied to the modeling of protein interactions and complexes, from large macromolecular machines to domain-domain and peptide-mediated interactions. In particular, we place a special emphasis on those methods that can be applied in a proteome-wide manner, and discuss how they will help in the ultimate objective of building 3D interactome networks. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Concurrent developments in systems biology allow for prediction of the functional effects of system perturbations using large-scale network models. Integration of these two capabilities provides a framework for evaluating metabolic drug response phenotypes in silico. This combined approach was applied to investigate the hypertensive side effect of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor torcetrapib in the context of human renal function. A metabolic kidney model was generated in which to simulate drug treatment. Causal drug off-targets were predicted that have previously been observed to impact renal function in gene-deficient patients and may play a role in the adverse side effects observed in clinical trials. Genetic risk factors for drug treatment were also predicted that correspond to both characterized and unknown renal metabolic disorders as well as cryptic genetic deficiencies that are not expected to exhibit a renal disorder phenotype except under drug treatment. This study represents a novel integration of structural and systems biology and a first step towards computational systems medicine. The methodology introduced herein has important implications for drug development and personalized medicine.},

As the ability to measure molecules in high-throughput ways has improved over the past decade, it is logical that such data might be useful for enabling drug repositioning through computational methods. Many computational predictions for new indications have been borne out in cellular model systems, though extensive animal model and clinical trial-based validation are still pending. In this review, we show that computational methods for drug repositioning can be classified in two axes: drug based, where discovery initiates from the chemical perspective, or disease based, where discovery initiates from the clinical perspective of disease or its pathology. Newer algorithms for computational drug repositioning will likely span these two axes, will take advantage of newer types of molecular measurements, and will certainly play a role in reducing the global burden of disease.},

However, many effective drugs act via modulation of multiple proteins rather than single targets. Advances in systems biology are revealing a phenotypic robustness and a network structure that strongly suggests that exquisitely selective compounds, compared with multitarget drugs, may exhibit lower than desired clinical efficacy. This new appreciation of the role of polypharmacology has significant implications for tackling the two major sources of attrition in drug development--efficacy and toxicity. Integrating network biology and polypharmacology holds the promise of expanding the current opportunity space for druggable targets. However, the rational design of polypharmacology faces considerable challenges in the need for new methods to validate target combinations and optimize multiple structure-activity relationships while maintaining drug-like properties.

We highlight recent studies performed on the tripartite synapse, the structure consisting of pre- and postsynaptic elements of the synapse and an associated astrocytic process. Astrocytes respond to neuronal activity and neurotransmitters, through the activation of metabotropic receptors, and can release the gliotransmitters ATP, d-serine, and glutamate, which act on neurons. Astrocyte-derived ATP modulates synaptic transmission, either directly or through its metabolic product adenosine. d-serine modulates NMDA receptor function, whereas glia-derived glutamate can play important roles in relapse following withdrawal from drugs of abuse. Cell type-specific molecular genetics has allowed a new level of examination of the function of astrocytes in brain function and has revealed an important role of these glial cells that is mediated by adenosine accumulation in the control of sleep and in cognitive impairments that follow sleep deprivation.},

abstract = {Describing the connectivity of chemical and/or biological systems using networks is a straight gate for the introduction of mathematical tools in proteomics. Networks, in some cases even very large ones, are simple objects that are composed at least by nodes and edges. The nodes represent the parts of the system and the edges geometric and/or functional relationships between parts. In proteomics, amino acids, proteins, electrophoresis spots, polypeptidic fragments, or more complex objects can play the role of nodes. All of these networks can be numerically described using the so-called Connectivity Indices (CIs). The transformation of graphs (a picture) into CIs (numbers) facilitates the manipulation of information and the search for structure-function relationships in Proteomics. In this work, we review and comment on the challenges and new trends in the definition and applications of CIs in Proteomics. Emphasis is placed on 1-D-CIs for DNA and protein sequences, 2-D-CIs for RNA secondary structures, 3-D-topographic indices (TPGIs) for protein function annotation without alignment, 2-D-CIs and 3-D-TPGIs for the study of drug-protein or drug-RNA quantitative structure-binding relationships, and pseudo 3-D-CIs for protein surface molecular recognition. We also focus on CIs to describe Protein Interaction Networks or RNA co-expression networks. 2-D-CIs for patient blood proteome 2-DE maps or mass spectra are also covered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is a daunting task to identify all the metabolic pathways of brain energy metabolism and develop a dynamic simulation environment that will cover a time scale ranging from seconds to hours. To simplify this task and make it more practicable, we undertook stoichiometric modeling of brain energy metabolism with the major aim of including the main interacting pathways in and between astrocytes and neurons. MODEL: The constructed model includes central metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle), lipid metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, amino acid metabolism (synthesis and catabolism), the well-known glutamate-glutamine cycle, other coupling reactions between astrocytes and neurons, and neurotransmitter metabolism. This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive attempt at stoichiometric modeling of brain metabolism to date in terms of its coverage of a wide range of metabolic pathways. We then attempted to model the basal physiological behaviour and hypoxic behaviour of the brain cells where astrocytes and neurons are tightly coupled. RESULTS: The reconstructed stoichiometric reaction model included 217 reactions (184 internal, 33 exchange) and 216 metabolites (183 internal, 33 external) distributed in and between astrocytes and neurons. Flux balance analysis (FBA) techniques were applied to the reconstructed model to elucidate the underlying cellular principles of neuron-astrocyte coupling. Simulation of resting conditions under the constraints of maximization of glutamate/glutamine/GABA cycle fluxes between the two cell types with subsequent minimization of Euclidean norm of fluxes resulted in a flux distribution in accordance with literature-based findings. As a further validation of our model, the effect of oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) on fluxes was simulated using an FBA-derivative approach, known as minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA). The results show the power of the constructed model to simulate disease behaviour on the flux level, and its potential to analyze cellular metabolic behaviour in silico. CONCLUSION: The predictive power of the constructed model for the key flux distributions, especially central carbon metabolism and glutamate-glutamine cycle fluxes, and its application to hypoxia is promising. The resultant acceptable predictions strengthen the power of such stoichiometric models in the analysis of mammalian cell metabolism.},

abstract = {Astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system, are intimately associated with synapses. They play a pivotal role in neuronal survival and the brain inflammatory response. Some astrocytic functions are mediated by the secretion of polypeptides. Using a proteomic approach, we have identified more than 30 proteins released by cultured astrocytes. These include proteases and protease inhibitors, carrier proteins, and antioxidant proteins. Exposing astrocytes to brefeldin A, which selectively blocks secretory vesicle assembly, suppressed the release of some of these proteins. This indicates that astrocytes secrete these proteins by a classic vesicular mechanism and others by an alternative pathway. Astrocytes isolated from different brain regions secreted a similar pattern of proteins. However, the secretion of some of them, including metalloproteinase inhibitors and apolipoprotein E, was region-specific. In addition, pro-inflammatory treatments modified the profile of astrocytic protein secretion. Finally, more than two thirds of the proteins identified in the astrocyte-conditioned medium were detectable in the mouse cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that astrocytes contribute to the cerebrospinal fluid protein content. In conclusion, this study provides the first unbiased characterization of the major proteins released by astrocytes, which may play a crucial role in the modulation of neuronal survival and function.},

The second objective was to examine whether any quantitative $\backslash$ndifferences in the secretion profiles between primary astrocytes and astrocytes in a scratch injury model of reactive $\backslash$nastrogliosis could be found. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify secreted proteins in serum-containing $\backslash$nmedium using a proteomic approach involving stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell cultures and mass $\backslash$nspectrometry.},

abstract = {Senescence-accelerated prone (SAMP) strain 8 mice suffer an earlier development of cognitive age-related pathologies and a shorter life span than conventional mice. Protein alterations in astrocytes, in addition to those in neurons, may contribute to neurodegenerative damage. We applied proteomics techniques to study cell-specific early markers of brain aging-related degeneration in SAMP8. The two-dimensional protein expression patterns of the SAMP8 neuron and astrocyte cultures were compared with those obtained from senescence-accelerated resistant mouse strain 1 cultures. Differentially expressed spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight peptide map fingerprinting and database search. Proteins belonged to cell pathways of energy metabolism, biosynthesis, cell transduction and signaling, stress response, and the maintenance of cytoskeletal functions. Most of the changes were cell type specific. However, there was a general increase in cell transduction, signaling, and stress-related proteins and a decrease in cytoskeletal proteins. In addition, neurons showed an increased expression of proteins involved in biosynthetic pathways. A number of the protein alterations have been previously reported in the brain tissue proteome of SAMP8, aged brain or Alzheimer's disease brain. Alterations in neuron and astrocyte proteoma indicated that both cell types are involved in the brain degenerative changes of SAMP8 mice. However, network analysis suggests that neuronal changes are more complex and have a greater influence.},

abstract = {The roles of astrocytes in the CNS have been expanding beyond the long held view of providing passive, supportive functions. Recent evidence has identified roles in neuronal development, extracellular matrix maintenance, and response to inflammatory challenges. Therefore, insights into astrocyte secretion are critically important for understanding physiological responses and pathological mechanisms in CNS diseases. Primary astrocyte cultures were treated with inflammatory cytokines for either a short (1 day) or sustained (7 days) exposure. Increased interleukin-6 secretion, nitric oxide production, cyclooxygenase-2 activation, and nerve growth factor (NGF) secretion confirmed the astrocytic response to cytokine treatment. MS/MS analysis, computational prediction algorithms, and functional classification were used to compare the astrocyte protein secretome from control and cytokine-exposed cultures. In total, 169 secreted proteins were identified, including both classically and nonconventionally secreted proteins that comprised components of the extracellular matrix and enzymes involved in processing of glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans. Twelve proteins were detected exclusively in the secretome from cytokine-treated astrocytes, including matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and members of the chemokine ligand family. This compilation of secreted proteins provides a framework for identifying factors that influence the biochemical environment of the nervous system, regulate development, construct extracellular matrices, and coordinate the nervous system response to inflammation.},

The current work utilized SILAC-generated isotope reference proteomes to quantify relative protein abundances between the astrocyte proteome and secretome. Multidimensional GeLC-MS/MS analysis of astrocyte conditioned media and cell lysates resulted in the relative quantification of 516 proteins, 92 of which were greater than 1.5-fold enriched in astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM). Eighty of the ACM-enriched proteins had N-terminal signal peptides, comprising well-known classically secreted proteins, such as apolipoprotein E and SPARC, and several cathepsins that localize to endosomal/lysosomal compartments. The remaining twelve ACM-enriched proteins, such as vimentin, ferritins, and histones, lacked N-terminal signal peptides. Also, 47 proteins contained predicted N-terminal signal peptides but were not enriched in ACM ({\textless}1.5-fold), 25 of which were localized to ER, Golgi, or mitochondria membrane-bound compartments. Overall, by combining quantitative proteomics with subcellular localization prediction, an informative description of protein distribution can be obtained, providing insights into protein secretion.},

abstract = {Tibolone appears to be at least as efficacious as other forms of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) on climacteric symptoms. It does not cause withdrawal bleeding when used in women with at least 1 year of amenorrhea. It is, therefore, not indicated in perimenopause because it may cause irregular bleeding. The androgenic action of tibolone may have a two-fold benefit: on the one hand, it may help depression and libido more than other forms of HRT, while, on the other hand, it may improve some lipid parameters such as Lp(a), and triglycerides. However, this androgenic action, may also be responsible for the reduction of HDL cholesterol, that may thus reduce the beneficial effect of tibolone on lipids. It is estimated that only 30{\%} of cardiovascular risk protection of HRT is due to improvement of classical lipids parameters while a great role is played by the direct effect of estrogen on vessels. Tibolone, as well as estrogen, has been shown to induce peripheral vasodilatation and also has a direct effect on vascular reactivity thus increasing peripheral blood flow with no changes in blood pressure or cardiac output. Tibolone seems to exert a similar effect as other forms of HRT on markers of bone metabolism and bone mass, but no data is yet available on fracture prevention.

abstract = {Since the discovery that obesity is associated with macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue,1,2 mechanisms by which adipose tissue becomes inflamed, resulting in insulin resistance, have remained elusive. Several studies have demonstrated that saturated fatty acids (SFAs) stimulate adipose tissue inflammation by a process that involves Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a receptor that binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLR4 is a pattern recognition receptor that plays a key role in the innate immune response. The observation that TLR4 deficiency protected against insulin resistance in obesity induced by a diet high in SFAs3 suggested that TLR4 was the link between diet excess and insulin resistance.3 Attenuation of diet-induced insulin resistance4,5 and adipose tissue inflammation6 also have been observed in C3H/HeJ mice with a loss of function mutation in TLR4. See accompanying article on page 802 In vitro studies have shed light on how SFAs lead to adipose tissue inflammation. TLR4 activation by SFAs increases the expression of a number of inflammatory genes in adipocytes by a nuclear factor {\{}kappa{\}}B–dependent mechanism,7–11 similar to TLR4 activation by LPS. SFAs also stimulate inflammatory molecules in macrophages.3,10–12 TLR4's critical role has been demonstrated by silencing TLR4 expression with short interfering RNA9,13,14 or by the use of TLR4-mutant macrophages.11,15 On the basis of coculture experiments, macrophages recruited into adipose tissue by SFAs have been shown to secrete tumor necrosis factor-{\{}alpha{\}}, thus establishing a paracrine loop that aggravates adipose tissue inflammation.10 There also appears to be specificity, in that palmitate, laurate, and myristate activate inflammatory genes in adipocytes,9,10 whereas stearate does not.9 However, palmitate and stearate both activate inflammatory gene expression in macrophages in a TLR4-dependent fashion.3,14 Moreover, laurate stimulates nuclear factor {\{}kappa{\}}B activation in macrophages, and the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid inhibits it.15 SFA also can induce inflammation macrophages by stimulating TLR2 that is dimerized with TLR6 or TLR1,14,16 an effect that is inhibited by docosahexaenoic acid.15,17 Thus, TLRs in various cells can be differentially modulated by different fatty acids. The mechanism by which SFAs activate TLR4 may involve effects of SFAs on TLR4 receptor number, dimerization, lipid rafts, and the balance between saturated and unsaturated fats. Although LPS binds TLR4 by a process that also involves CD14, radiolabeled SFAs did not bind directly to TLR4.18 Although one study showed that free fatty acids failed to enhance TLR4 dimerization,15 another showed that SFAs induce TLR4 dimerization and recruitment into lipid rafts,19 a potentially important mechanism by which TLR signaling is modulated by dietary fats. For example, altering lipid composition in rafts by incorporating docosahexaenoic acid resulted in disruption of TLR4 recruitment into lipid rafts and reduced downstream signaling.19 However, SFAs do not activate downstream targets of TLR4 directly.20,21 One study showed that stimulation of TLRs by fatty acids was due to minor LPS contamination of the albumin to which they were complexed,22 although other studies have taken considerable care to remove LPS.9 TLR4 expression is increased in patients with atherosclerosis,23 and the expression of TLR4 can also be enhanced by high blood glucose and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.24,25 Thus, upregulation of TLR4 expression may enhance the sensitivity of cells to inflammatory signaling. The propensity for the activation of TLR signaling may also be affected by the balance between stimulatory SFAs and inhibitory n-3 fatty acids. This might be important because immune cells exposed to plasma SFAs would be continuously activated if not for the inhibitory fatty acids. The study by Schwartz et al in this issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology sheds new light on how SFAs cause adipose tissue inflammation. In this study THP-1 monocytes and human monocytes and macrophages exposed to SFAs demonstrated enhanced interleukin-8 and interleukin-6 expression in response to low dose LPS.14 Amplification of the LPS response required metabolism of the SFAs to ceramide, and it involved activation of C-{\{}zeta{\}}/mitogen-activated protein kinase. It demonstrates a novel way by which fatty acids might modulate the innate immune response, ie, by their metabolites cooperatively enhancing TLR/nuclear factor {\{}kappa{\}}B–mediated inflammation. LPS frequently circulates at low concentrations in the bloodstream because of absorption from the bacterial flora of the gut, subclinical infections, or food contamination. The simultaneous ingestion of foods rich in SFAs might amplify stimulation of inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. Minimal contamination of reagents with LPS might also explain some of the in vitro findings with SFAs. However, they do not explain why some fatty acids have no effect whereas others inhibit inflammatory gene expression,9,12,17 because they all are complexed with albumin, the most likely source of LPS contamination. Deficiency of TLR4, confined to macrophages, was not associated with a reduction of macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue or insulin resistance in response to a SFA-rich diet in mice.26 However, total body TLR4 deficiency or a nonfunctional mutation of the TLR4 gene was associated with reduced insulin resistance and macrophage accumulation in response to a high-fat diet.3–6 If the findings with deficiency of TLR4 in macrophages are confirmed, this suggests that TLR4 on adipocytes rather than macrophages might play an important role in macrophage accrual and insulin resistance in response to a diet rich in SFAs. One way that this might work is by adipocytes generating monocyte chemotactic factors,9 which play an important role in macrophage accumulation and insulin resistance in adipose tissue. Activation of TLR4 by SFAs on endothelial cells also may lead to insulin resistance at sites such as the artery wall,27 perhaps suggesting a common mechanism for fatty acid–induced insulin resistance in several cells, such as adipocytes,3,6,9 B cells,19 and myotubes.28 The current study thus adds a new level of complexity to an evolving story concerning the role of dietary SFAs in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Future studies concerning the interplay of fatty acids, LPS, and TLRs are likely to further unravel the intricate web that leads to adipose tissue inflammation.},

Although the medical literature also implicates head trauma as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, these findings are predominantly based on clinical diagnostic criteria that lack specificity. The dementia that follows head injuries or repetitive mild trauma may be caused by chronic traumatic encephalopathy, alone or in conjunction with other neurodegenerations (for example, Alzheimer's disease). Prospective longitudinal studies of head-injured individuals, with neuropathological verification, will not only improve understanding of head trauma as a risk factor for dementia but will also enhance treatment and prevention of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is seen by the insurance industry and many health care providers as an "event." Once treated and provided with a brief period of rehabilitation, the perception exists that patients with a TBI require little further treatment and face no lasting effects on the central nervous system or other organ systems. In fact, TBI is a chronic disease process, one that fits the World Health Organization definition as having one or more of the following characteristics: it is permanent, caused by non-reversible pathological alterations, requires special training of the patient for rehabilitation, and/or may require a long period of observation, supervision, or care. TBI increases long-term mortality and reduces life expectancy. It is associated with increased incidences of seizures, sleep disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, neuroendocrine dysregulation, and psychiatric diseases, as well as non-neurological disorders such as sexual dysfunction, bladder and bowel incontinence, and systemic metabolic dysregulation that may arise and/or persist for months to years post-injury. The purpose of this article is to encourage the classification of TBI as the beginning of an ongoing, perhaps lifelong process, that impacts multiple organ systems and may be disease causative and accelerative. Our intent is not to discourage patients with TBI or their families and caregivers, but rather to emphasize that TBI should be managed as a chronic disease and defined as such by health care and insurance providers. Furthermore, if the chronic nature of TBI is recognized by government and private funding agencies, research can be directed at discovering therapies that may interrupt the disease processes months or even years after the initiating event.},

abstract = {A single traumatic brain injury is associated with an increased risk of dementia and, in a proportion of patients surviving a year or more from injury, the development of hallmark Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies. However, the pathological processes linking traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disease remain poorly understood. Growing evidence supports a role for neuroinflammation in the development of Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, little is known about the neuroinflammatory response to brain injury and, in particular, its temporal dynamics and any potential role in neurodegeneration. Cases of traumatic brain injury with survivals ranging from 10 h to 47 years post injury (n = 52) and age-matched, uninjured control subjects (n = 44) were selected from the Glasgow Traumatic Brain Injury archive. From these, sections of the corpus callosum and adjacent parasaggital cortex were examined for microglial density and morphology, and for indices of white matter pathology and integrity. With survival of ≥3 months from injury, cases with traumatic brain injury frequently displayed extensive, densely packed, reactive microglia (CR3/43- and/or CD68-immunoreactive), a pathology not seen in control subjects or acutely injured cases. Of particular note, these reactive microglia were present in 28{\%} of cases with survival of {\textgreater}1 year and up to 18 years post-trauma. In cases displaying this inflammatory pathology, evidence of ongoing white matter degradation could also be observed. Moreover, there was a 25{\%} reduction in the corpus callosum thickness with survival {\textgreater}1 year post-injury. These data present striking evidence of persistent inflammation and ongoing white matter degeneration for many years after just a single traumatic brain injury in humans. Future studies to determine whether inflammation occurs in response to or, conversely, promotes white matter degeneration will be important. These findings may provide parallels for studying neurodegenerative disease, with traumatic brain injury patients serving as a model for longitudinal investigations, in particular with a view to identifying potential therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {The heterogeneity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered one of the most significant barriers to finding effective therapeutic interventions. In October, 2007, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, with support from the Brain Injury Association of America, the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, and the National Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation Research, convened a workshop to outline the steps needed to develop a reliable, efficient and valid classification system for TBI that could be used to link specific patterns of brain and neurovascular injury with appropriate therapeutic interventions. Currently, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the primary selection criterion for inclusion in most TBI clinical trials. While the GCS is extremely useful in the clinical management and prognosis of TBI, it does not provide specific information about the pathophysiologic mechanisms which are responsible for neurological deficits and targeted by interventions. On the premise that brain injuries with similar pathoanatomic features are likely to share common pathophysiologic mechanisms, participants proposed that a new, multidimensional classification system should be developed for TBI clinical trials. It was agreed that preclinical models were vital in establishing pathophysiologic mechanisms relevant to specific pathoanatomic types of TBI and verifying that a given therapeutic approach improves outcome in these targeted TBI types. In a clinical trial, patients with the targeted pathoanatomic injury type would be selected using an initial diagnostic entry criterion, including their severity of injury. Coexisting brain injury types would be identified and multivariate prognostic modeling used for refinement of inclusion/exclusion criteria and patient stratification. Outcome assessment would utilize endpoints relevant to the targeted injury type. Advantages and disadvantages of currently available diagnostic, monitoring, and assessment tools were discussed. Recommendations were made for enhancing the utility of available or emerging tools in order to facilitate implementation of a pathoanatomic classification approach for clinical trials.},

abstract = {The complicated secondary molecular and cellular mechanisms following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are still not fully understood. In the present study, we have used mass spectrometry to identify injury specific proteins in an in vitro model of TBI. A standardized injury was induced by scalpel cuts through a mixed cell culture of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Twenty-four hours after the injury, cell culture medium and whole-cell fractions were collected for analysis. We found 53 medium proteins and 46 cell fraction proteins that were specifically expressed after injury and the known function of these proteins was elucidated by an extensive literature survey. By using time-lapse microscopy and immunostainings we could link a large proportion of the proteins to specific cellular processes that occur in response to trauma; including cell death, proliferation, lamellipodia formation, axonal regeneration, actin remodeling, migration and inflammation. A high percentage of the proteins uniquely expressed in the medium after injury were actin-related proteins, which normally are situated intracellularly. We show that two of these, ezrin and moesin, are expressed by astrocytes both in the cell culture model and in mouse brain subjected to experimental TBI. Interestingly, we found many inflammation-related proteins, despite the fact that cells were present in the culture. This study contributes with important knowledge about the cellular responses after trauma and identifies several potential cell-specific biomarkers.},

abstract = {This study describes the effects of long-chain fatty acids on inflammatory signaling in cultured astrocytes. Data show that the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid, as well as lauric acid and stearic acid, trigger the release of TNF$\alpha$ and IL-6 from astrocytes. Unsaturated fatty acids were unable to induce cytokine release from cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, the effects of palmitic acid on cytokine release require Toll-like receptor 4 rather than CD36 or Toll-like receptor 2, and do not depend on palmitic acid metabolism to palmitoyl-CoA. Inhibitor studies revealed that pharmacologic inhibition of p38 or p42/44 MAPK pathways prevents the pro-inflammatory effects of palmitic acid, whereas JNK and PI3K inhibition does not affect cytokine release. Depletion of microglia from primary astrocyte cultures using the lysosomotropic agent l-leucine methyl ester revealed that the ability of palmitic acid to trigger cytokine release is not dependent on the presence of microglia. Finally, data show that the essential $\omega$-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid acts in a dose-dependent manner to prevent the actions of palmitic acid on inflammatory signaling in astrocytes. Collectively, these data demonstrate the ability of saturated fatty acids to induce astrocyte inflammation in vitro. These data thus raise the possibility that high levels of circulating saturated fatty acids could cause reactive gliosis and brain inflammation in vivo, and could potentially participate in the reported adverse neurologic consequences of obesity and metabolic syndrome.},

Although many proteins are found accumulating after TBI, three have received particular attention; beta-amyloid precursor protein and its proteolytic products, amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, neurofilament proteins, and synuclein proteins. Massive coaccumulations of all of these proteins are found in damaged axons throughout the white matter after TBI. Additionally, these proteins form aggregates in other neuronal compartments and in brain parenchyma after brain trauma. Interestingly, TBI is also an epigenetic risk factor for developing neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Here, the similarities and differences of these accumulations with pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases will be explored. In addition, the potential deleterious roles of protein accumulations on functional outcome and progressive neurodegeneration following TBI will be examined.},

In the nervous system, where fatty acids are found in huge amounts, they participate in its development and maintenance throughout life. Growing evidence strongly indicates that fatty acids in their own right are also implicated in pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, mental disorders, stroke, and trauma. In this review, we focus on recent studies that demonstrate the relationships between fatty acids and function and dysfunction of the nervous system. Fatty acids stimulate gene expression and neuronal activity, boost synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, and prevent neuroinflammation and apoptosis. By doing so, they promote brain development, ameliorate cognitive functions, serve as anti-depressants and anti-convulsants, bestow protection against traumatic insults, and enhance repairing processes. On the other hand, unbalance between different fatty acid families or excess of some of them generate deleterious side effects, which limit the translatability of successful results in experimental settings into effective therapeutic strategies for humans. Despite these constraints, there exists realistic evidence to consider that nutritional therapies based on fatty acids can be of benefit to several currently incurable nervous system diseases.},

The present study examines the role of fatty acids in causing hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, one of the characteristic signatures of AD pathology. Hyperphosphorylation of tau disrupts the cell cytoskeleton and leads to neuronal degeneration. Here, primary rat cortical neurons and astrocytes were treated with saturated free fatty acids (FFAs), palmitic and stearic acids. There was no change in the levels of phosphorylated tau in rat cortical neurons treated directly with these FFAs. The conditioned media from FFA-treated astrocytes, however, caused hyperphosphorylation of tau in the cortical neurons at AD-specific phospho-epitopes. Co-treatment of neurons with N-acetyl cysteine, an antioxidant, reduced FFA-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau. The present results establish a central role of FFAs in causing hyperphosphorylation of tau through astroglia-mediated oxidative stress. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Lipid second messengers such as arachidonic acid and its metabolites and diacylglycerols (DAGs) are affected in brain injury. Therefore, changes in the pool size and the fatty acid composition of free fatty acids (FFAs) and DAGs were analyzed in different rat brain areas 4 and 35 days after traumatic injury. Cortical impact injury of low-grade severity was applied in the right frontal somatosensory cortex. Four days after injury, FFAs and DAGs were increased by three- and twofold, respectively, in the injured cortex and to a lesser extent in the contralateral cortex compared with sham-operated animals. Docosahexaenoic acid followed by stearic acid, and arachidonic acid, displayed the greatest changes in both FFAs and DAGs. By day 35, free stearic, oleic, and arachidonic acids remained elevated in the damaged cortex (1.5-fold each). DAGs showed the greatest change, reaching values 2.7-fold higher than sham in all frontal and occipital cortical areas, including brainstem. Oleoyl- and arachidonoyl-DAGs (four- and threefold increase, respectively) followed by docosahexaenoyl-DAGs (twofold) contributed to the DAG accumulation. These results reveal that traumatic brain injury triggers a sustained and time-dependent activation of phospholipase-mediated signaling pathways leading to membrane phospholipid degradation and targeting, early on, docosahexaenoyl phospholipid-enriched excitable membranes.},

abstract = {Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell types in the brain, provide metabolic and trophic support to neurons and modulate synaptic activity. Accordingly, impairment in these astrocyte functions can critically influence neuronal survival. Recent studies show that astrocyte apoptosis may contribute to pathogenesis of many acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We found that incubation of cultured rat astrocytes in a Ca2+-containing medium after exposure to a Ca2+-free medium causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration followed by apoptosis, and that NF-??B, reactive oxygen species, and enzymes such as calpain, xanthine oxidase, calcineurin and caspase-3 are involved in reperfusion-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that heat shock protein, mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase are target molecules for anti-apoptotic drugs. This review summarizes (1) astrocytic functions in neuroprotection, (2) current evidence of astrocyte apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo studies including its molecular pathways such as Ca2+ overload, oxidative stress, NF-??B activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and protease activation, and (3) several drugs preventing astrocyte apoptosis. As a whole, this article provides new insights into the potential role of astrocytes as targets for neuroprotection. In addition, the advance in the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of astrocyte apoptosis may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Decades of pathological and physiological studies have focused on neuronal abnormalities in these disorders, but it is becoming increasingly evident that astrocytes are also important players in these and other neurological disorders. Our understanding of the normative biology of astrocytes has been aided by the development of animal models in which astrocyte-specific proteins and pathways have been manipulated, and mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases have also revealed astrocyte-specific pathologies that contribute to neurodegeneration. These models have led to the development of targeted therapies for pathways in which astrocytes participate, and this research should ultimately influence the clinical treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.},

One other factor, the additional principal components analysis factor in the fasted state (PCF2-Fasted), reflected a wide range of acylcarnitines and was affected by diet in women only (P = 0.0198; HPA greater than HOA). HOA lowered the ratio of serum low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein (LDL:HDL) in men and women, and adjustment for the PCF1-Fasted abolished the effect. In women only, adjustment for the PCF2-Fasted eliminated the HOA-diet effect on serum total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. The respiratory exchange ratio in the fasted state was lower with the HPA diet (P = 0.04), and the diet effect was eliminated after adjustment for the PCF1-Fasted. The messenger RNA expression of the cholesterol regulatory gene insulin-induced gene-1 was higher with the HOA diet (P = 0.008).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that replacing dietary PA with OA reduces the blood LDL concentration and whole-body fat oxidation by modifying the saturation index of circulating and tissue lipids. In women, these effects are also associated with a higher production and accumulation of acylcarnitines, possibly reflecting a shift in fat catabolism.},

@article{Lipton1999,
abstract = {This review is directed at understanding how neuronal death occurs in two distinct insults, global ischemia and focal ischemia. These are the two principal rodent models for human disease. Cell death occurs by a necrotic pathway characterized by either ischemic/homogenizing cell change or edematous cell change. Death also occurs via an apoptotic-like pathway that is characterized, minimally, by DNA laddering and a dependence on caspase activity and, optimally, by those properties, additional characteristic protein and phospholipid changes, and morphological attributes of apoptosis. Death may also occur by autophagocytosis. The cell death process has four major stages. The first, the induction stage, includes several changes initiated by ischemia and reperfusion that are very likely to play major roles in cell death. These include inhibition (and subsequent reactivation) of electron transport, decreased ATP, decreased pH, increased cell Ca(2+), release of glutamate, increased arachidonic acid, and also gene activation leading to cytokine synthesis, synthesis of enzymes involved in free radical production, and accumulation of leukocytes. These changes lead to the activation of five damaging events, termed perpetrators. These are the damaging actions of free radicals and their product peroxynitrite, the actions of the Ca(2+)-dependent protease calpain, the activity of phospholipases, the activity of poly-ADPribose polymerase (PARP), and the activation of the apoptotic pathway. The second stage of cell death involves the long-term changes in macromolecules or key metabolites that are caused by the perpetrators. The third stage of cell death involves long-term damaging effects of these macromolecular and metabolite changes, and of some of the induction processes, on critical cell functions and structures that lead to the defined end stages of cell damage. These targeted functions and structures include the plasmalemma, the mitochondria, the cytoskeleton, protein synthesis, and kinase activities. The fourth stage is the progression to the morphological and biochemical end stages of cell death. Of these four stages, the last two are the least well understood. Quite little is known of how the perpetrators affect the structures and functions and whether and how each of these changes contribute to cell death. According to this description, the key step in ischemic cell death is adequate activation of the perpetrators, and thus a major unifying thread of the review is a consideration of how the changes occurring during and after ischemia, including gene activation and synthesis of new proteins, conspire to produce damaging levels of free radicals and peroxynitrite, to activate calpain and other Ca(2+)-driven processes that are damaging, and to initiate the apoptotic process. Although it is not fully established for all cases, the major driving force for the necrotic cell death process, and very possibly the other processes, appears to be the generation of free radicals and peroxynitrite. Effects of a large number of damaging changes can be explained on the basis of their ability to generate free radicals in early or late stages of damage. Several important issues are defined for future study. These include determining the triggers for apoptosis and autophagocytosis and establishing greater confidence in most of the cellular changes that are hypothesized to be involved in cell death. A very important outstanding issue is identifying the critical functional and structural changes caused by the perpetrators of cell death. These changes are responsible for cell death, and their identity and mechanisms of action are almost completely unknown.},

abstract = {In postmenopausal women tibolone has proved to prevent bone-loss and relieve climacteric symptoms as effectively as estrogens, but it does not stimulate the endometrium and the breast. This clinical profile strongly suggests that tibolone is a compound with tissue-specific action. Tibolone is quickly metabolized into its main active metabolites, 3?? and 3??-OH, which are also present in an inactive, sulphated, form. In addition a ??4-metabolite is found in circulation. The 3-OH-metabolites bind only to the estrogen receptor while the ??4-isomer shows affinity only to the progesterone and androgen receptors. Tibolone prevents bone loss in a similar way to estrogens. Studies on bone mass using anti-estrogen, antiprogestin and anti-androgen in combination with tibolone, confirmed the sole involvement of the estradiol receptor. Increases in skin temperature as well as vaginal atrophy can be prevented by tibolone in a similar way to estrogens. Breast safety studies showed that tibolone clearly inhibited the growth of tumors in a DMBA model. In breast cell lines, tibolone profoundly inhibited sulphatase activity and an increase in apoptosis and decrease in cell proliferation was found. The stimulation of the endometrium is prevented by the local formation of the ??4-isomer from tibolone or the 3??-OH-metabolite. We conclude that tibolone acts as a tissue-specific compound by mediating its effects via steroid receptors and enzymatic pathways. This dual effect of tibolone explains it's positive clinical effects on bone, vagina and brain, and avoids stimulation of the endometrium and breast tissue. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Many central astrocytic functions in metabolism, amino acid neurotransmission and calcium signaling were discovered using this tissue culture preparation and most of these observations were subsequently found in vivo.

In 2011 in Medellin, Colombia, there were 307 traffic deaths and 23,835 injured with 411 accidents for each 10,000 vehicles. Objective: The purpose of the study was to describe the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, as well as the quality of life and disability outcomes for those injured in traffic accidents in Medellin. Methods: This prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study collected data from 834 patients that were classified with the New Injury Severity Score (NISS) , the WHODAS-II (Disability Assessment) Scale and the SF-36 Health Survey. Results: Three-fourths (75.8{\%}) of the patients were male. Eighty-one percent of patients were involved in motorcycle accidents, with 45.6{\%} suffering moderate trauma, and 32.6{\%} experiencing severe trauma. Of the patients with severe trauma, 8.5{\%} were not wearing helmets. Half of the sample (49.7{\%}) injured their extremities. The WHODAS-II domains most affected were: Activities outside the home (62.0 {\%}), Housework (54.3{\%}) and Moving in one's environment (45.2 {\%}). Quality of life areas affected were: Physical role (20.3), Body pain (37.3 {\%}) Emotional role (44.1{\%}), Physical functioning (52.6 {\%}). Conclusions: Patients with more severe injuries had higher levels of disability and a worse quality of life. Motorcycles made up a large proportion of traffic accidents in this city and mitigation strategies to reduce this public health problem should particularly focus on this high-risk group.},

abstract = {Tibolone is effective in preventing bone loss and treating climacteric symptoms, without stimulating the endometrium. The effects on bone, brain and vagina can be accurately explained by the oestrogenic activity of tibolone, but oestrogenic activity is not expressed in the endometrium. Tibolone behaves differently from oestrogen plus progestogen combinations on the breast. Therefore, tibolone can be characterised as a selective oestrogen activity regulator. The objective of this review is to characterise the typical properties of tibolone in order to explain its tissue-selective action. Tibolone is rapidly converted into three major metabolites: 3??- and 3??-hydroxy-tibolone, which have oestrogenic effects, and the ??4-isomer, which has progestogenic and androgenic effects. The 3-hydroxy metabolites are present in the circulation, predominantly in their inactive sulphated form. The tissue-selective effects of tibolone are the result of metabolism, enzyme regulation and receptor activation that vary in different tissues. The bone preserving effects are the result of oestradiol receptor activation, whilst other steroid receptors, notably the progesterone and androgen receptor, are not involved. Breast tissue of monkeys is not stimulated, as occurs with oestrogen plus progestogen, because tibolone and its metabolites inhibit sulphatase and 17??-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate sulphotransferase and 17??-HSD type II, the combined effects of which prevent conversion to active oestrogens. In addition, tibolone affects cellular homeostasis in the breast by inhibiting proliferation and stimulating apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium because of the action of the highly stable progestogenic metabolite (??4-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulphatase (inhibition)-sulphotransferase (stimulation) system. The oestrogenic metabolites of tibolone have direct favourable effects on the cardiovascular system and, in in vivo models, tibolone has shown no adverse consequences. In conclusion, tibolone shows oestrogenic effects in brain, vagina and bone and has direct oestrogenic effects on the cardiovascular system. In the endometrium, the progestogenic activity of the ??4-metabolite and the effect on oestrogen-inactivating enzymes prevent oestrogenic stimulation. The mammary gland is not stimulated in currently used animal models. Tibolone appears to regulate estrogenic activity in the various tissues by influencing the availability of estrogenic compounds for the estradiol receptor in a tissue-selective manner. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, work over the past decade has revealed that they interact with the vasculature to form a gliovascular network that might organize not only the structural architecture of the brain but also its communication pathways, activation, thresholds and plasticity. The net effect is that astroglia demarcate gray matter regions, both cortical and subcortical, into functional compartments whose internal activation thresholds and external outputs are regulated by single glial cells. The array of these astrocyte-delimited microdomains along the capillary microvasculature allows the formation of higher-order gliovascular units, which serve to match local neural activity and blood flow while regulating neuronal firing thresholds through coordinative glial signaling. By these means, astrocytes might establish the functional as well as the structural architecture of the adult brain.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides appear to be ubiquitous and multipotent components of the innate immune defense arsenal used by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. During the past 15 years a multitude of these peptides have been isolated largely from insects. In spite of great differences in size, amino acid composition and structure, most of the antimicrobial peptides from insects can be grouped into one of three categories. The largest category in number contains peptides with intramolecular disulfide bonds forming hairpin-like $\beta$-sheets or $\alpha$-helical-$\beta$-sheet mixed structures. The second most important group is composed of peptides forming amphipathic $\alpha$-helices. The third group comprises peptides with an overrepresentation in proline and/or glycine residues. In general, the insect antimicrobial peptides have a broad range of activity and are not cytotoxic. Despite a wealth of information on structural requirements for their antimicrobial activity, the mode of action of these peptides is not yet fully understood. However, some data suggest the existence of two types of mode of action: 1. through peptide-lipid interaction or 2. through receptor-mediated recognition processes. This review presents the main results obtained during the last four years in the field of antimicrobial peptides from insects with a special focus on the proline-rich and cysteine-rich peptides.},

abstract = {The melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) plays a central role in regulation of eumelanin (black/brown) and phaeomelanin (red/yellow) synthesis within the mammalian melanocyte and is encoded by the classical Extension (E) coat color locus. Sequence analysis of MC1R from seven porcine breeds revealed a total of four allelic variants corresponding to five different E alleles. The European wild boar possessed a unique MC1R allele that we believe is required for the expression of a wild-type coat color. Two different MC1R alleles were associated with the dominant black color in pigs. MC1R*2 was found in European Large Black and Chinese Meishan pigs and exhibited two missense mutations compared with the wild-type sequence. Comparative data strongly suggest that one of these, L99P, may form a constitutively active receptor. MC1R*3 was associated with the black color in the Hampshire breed and involved a single missense mutation D121N. This same MC1R variant was also associated with EP, which results in black spots on a white or red background. Two different missense mutations were identified in recessive red (e/e) animals. One of these, A240T, occurs at a highly conserved position, making it a strong candidate for disruption of receptor function.},

By using nanoscopic paraffin like plates as model solutes, MD simulations in isothermal-isobaric ensemble have been employed to identify characteristic features of such an interface. Enhanced water correlation, density fluctuations, and position dependent compressibility apart from surface specific hydrogen bond distribution and molecular orientations have been identified as characteristic features of such interfaces. Tetrahedral order parameter that quantifies the degree of tetrahedrality in the water structure and an orientational order parameter, which quantifies the orientational preferences of the second solvation shell water around a central water molecule, have also been calculated as a function of distance from the plate surface. In the vicinity of the surface these two order parameters too show considerable sensitivity to the surface hydrophobicity. The potential of mean force (PMF) between water and the surface as a function of the distance from the surface has also been analyzed in terms of direct interaction and induced contribution, which shows unusual effect of plate hydrophobicity on the solvent induced PMF. In order to investigate hydrophobic nature of these plates, we have also investigated interplate dewetting when two such plates are immersed in water.},

The studies were focused on synthetic palmitic acid-containing lipopeptides, C16-KK-NH2 (I), C16-KGK-NH2 (II) and C16-KKKK-NH2 (III). The self-assembly was explored by molecular dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained force field. The critical micellar concentration was estimated by the surface tension measurements. The thermodynamics of the peptides binding to the anionic and zwitterionic lipids were established using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The influence of the peptides on the lipid acyl chain ordering was determined using FTIR spectroscopy. The compounds studied show surface-active properties with a distinct CMC over the millimolar range. An increase in the steric and electrostatic repulsion between polar head groups shifts the CMC toward higher values and reduces the aggregation number. An analysis of the peptide-membrane binding revealed a unique interplay between the initial electrostatic and the subsequent hydrophobic interactions enabling the lipopeptides to interact with the lipid bilayer. In the case of C16-KKKK-NH2 (III), compensation of the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions upon binding to the anionic membrane has been suggested and consequently no overall binding effects were noticed in ITC thermograms and FTIR spectra.},

abstract = {Gaduscidin-1 and -2 (GAD-1 and GAD-2) are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that contain several histidine residues and are thus expected to exhibit pH-dependent activity. In order to help elucidate their mechanism of membrane disruption, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations with the peptides in both histidine-charged and histidine-neutral forms, along with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipid molecules. The simulations employed GROMACS software and an OPLS-AA force field. Initially, the peptide and lipids were placed randomly in the simulation box and then were allowed to self-assemble. The results demonstrated a marked preference for the regions of the peptides that contain sequential pairs of histidine residues to associate closely with bilayer pores. This preference is observed even when the histidines are in their uncharged form. It appears that the relative compactness and rigidity of histidine pairs require the more aqueous and disordered environment of the pores to satisfy hydrophilic interactions. The final peptide structures exhibited a wide variety of structures and topologies, with the most helical structures positioning most parallel to the bilayer surface and the less ordered structures interacting more closely with the pore. Thus, the results give atomistic insight into those models of AMP mechanism that promote the importance of structural heterogeneity and imperfect amphipathicity to AMP activity and selectivity.},

abstract = {This work aims to investigate the possible mechanism of action of the homologue peptide Pa-MAP based on the Antarctic fish Pleuronectes americanus, through a study by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of models of bilayer lipid membranes supported (BLM-s) on solid substrates. For comparison and validation of the data obtained by EIS, we also conducted a study evaluating the human peptide LL-37, whose mechanism of action is well described in the literature: its dielectric response was found to be similar to that of Pa-MAP. The results obtained indicate that Pa-MAP has a good potential for use as a membrane-disrupting peptide and also suggest that the corresponding mechanism of action occurs according to the carpet model followed by a detergent-like effect. The addition of either one of these peptides at different concentrations resulted in a drastic decrease in the membrane's resistance, after just 1min of exposure. Additionally, it was seen that the peptides Pa-MAP and LL-37 may act on membranes with different charges, in an indication of a possible broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. These interactions with different membrane compositions have been attributed to the peptides' structure, mainly due to the presence of many hydrophobic amino acid residues, as observed by in silico studies. Here, we describe the Pa-MAP mechanism of action for the first time. Furthermore, we report the data demonstrating that EIS can be used for studies of peptide-membranes interaction, even when small changes on the surface of the electrode can be detected.},

abstract = {Research on antimicrobial peptides is in part driven by urgent medical needs such as the steady increase in pathogens being resistant to antibiotics. Despite the wealth of information compelling structure-function relationships are still scarce and thus the interfacial activity model has been proposed to bridge this gap. This model also applies to other interfacially active (membrane active) peptides such as cytolytic, cell penetrating or antitumor peptides. One parameter that is strongly linked to interfacial activity is the spontaneous lipid curvature, which is experimentally directly accessible. We discuss different parameters such as H-bonding, electrostatic repulsion, changes in monolayer surface area and lateral pressure that affect induction of membrane curvature, but also vice versa how membrane curvature triggers peptide response. In addition, the impact of membrane lipid composition on the formation of curved membrane structures and its relevance for diverse mode of action of interfacially active peptides and in turn biological activity are described.

abstract = {We have investigated in the present study the effect of both non-selective and selective cationic 14-mer peptides on the lipid orientation of DMPC bilayers by (31)P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Depending on the position of substitution, these peptides adopt mainly either an $\alpha$-helical structure able to permeabilize DMPC and DMPG vesicles (non-selective peptides) or an intermolecular $\beta$-sheet structure only able to permeabilize DMPG vesicles (selective peptides). Several systems have been investigated, namely bilayers mechanically oriented between glass plates as well as bicelles oriented with their normal perpendicular or parallel to the external magnetic field. The results have been compared with spectral simulations with the goal of elucidating the difference in the interaction of these two types of peptides with zwitterionic lipid bilayers. The results indicate that the perturbation induced by selective peptides is much greater than that induced by non-selective peptides in all the lipid systems investigated, and this perturbation has been associated to the aggregation of the selective $\beta$-sheet peptides in these systems. On the other hand, the oriented lipid spectra obtained in the presence of non-selective peptides suggest the presence of toroidal pores.

abstract = {Membrane-active antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are challenging to study experimentally, but relatively easy to investigate using molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. For this reason, a large number of MD studies of AMPs have been reported over recent years. Yet relatively little effort has focused on the validity of such simulations. Are these results reliable, and do they agree with what is known experimentally? And how much meaningful information can be obtained? To answer these questions, we demonstrate here some of the requirements and limitations of running MD simulations for several common AMPs: PGLa, melittin, maculatin and BP100. The two most important findings are: (a) simulation results depend strongly on force field parameters, making experimental verification of the simulations obligatory, and (b) slow orientational and conformational fluctuations mean that much longer sampling timescales (multi-$\mu$s) are needed if quantitative agreement between simulation averages and experimental data is to be achieved.

Because the MLP is shown to be sensitive to conformational effects, the MLP/log P relation is best sought by taking all conformers into account. The MLP method presented here can be used as a third field in CoMFA studies, as illustrated with two series of alpha 1-adrenoceptor ligands. In the first series, the steric, electrostatic and lipophilic fields are highly intercorrelated, and taken separately yield comparable models. In the second series of ligands, the best model is obtained with the lipophilic field alone, allowing insights into ligand-receptor interactions.},

@article{King1996,
abstract = {A protein secondary structure prediction method from multiply aligned homologous sequences is presented with an overall per residue three-state accuracy of 70.1{\%}. There are two aims: to obtain high accuracy by identification of a set of concepts important for prediction followed by use of linear statistics; and to provide insight into the folding process. The important concepts in secondary structure prediction are identified as: residue conformational propensities, sequence edge effects, moments of hydrophobicity, position of insertions and deletions in aligned homologous sequence, moments of conservation, auto-correlation, residue ratios, secondary structure feedback effects, and filtering. Explicit use of edge effects, moments of conservation, and auto-correlation are new to this paper. The relative importance of the concepts used in prediction was analyzed by stepwise addition of information and examination of weights in the discrimination function. The simple and explicit structure of the prediction allows the method to be reimplemented easily. The accuracy of a prediction is predictable a priori. This permits evaluation of the utility of the prediction: 10{\%} of the chains predicted were identified correctly as having a mean accuracy of {\textgreater} 80{\%}. Existing high-accuracy prediction methods are "black-box" predictors based on complex nonlinear statistics (e.g., neural networks in PHD: Rost {\&} Sander, 1993a). For medium- to short-length chains ({\textgreater} or = 90 residues and {\textless} 170 residues), the prediction method is significantly more accurate (P {\textless} 0.01) than the PHD algorithm (probably the most commonly used algorithm). In combination with the PHD, an algorithm is formed that is significantly more accurate than either method, with an estimated overall three-state accuracy of 72.4{\%}, the highest accuracy reported for any prediction method.},

@article{Sevcsik2007,
abstract = {The human, multifunctional peptide LL-37 causes membrane disruption by distinctly different mechanisms strongly dependent on the nature of the membrane lipid composition, varying not only with lipid headgroup charge but also with hydrocarbon chain length. Specifically, LL-37 induces a peptide-associated quasi-interdigitated phase in negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (PG) model membranes, where the hydrocarbon chains are shielded from water by the peptide. In turn, LL-37 leads to a disintegration of the lamellar organization of zwitterionic dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) into disk-like micelles. Interestingly, interdigitation was also observed for the longer-chain C18 and C20 PCs. This dual behavior of LL-37 can be attributed to a balance between electrostatic interactions reflected in different penetration depths of the peptide and hydrocarbon chain length. Thus, our observations indicate that there is a tight coupling between the peptide properties and those of the lipid bilayer, which needs to be considered in studies of lipid/peptide interaction. Very similar effects were also observed for melittin and the frog skin peptide PGLa. Therefore, we propose a phase diagram showing different lipid/peptide arrangements as a function of hydrocarbon chain length and LL-37 concentration and suggest that this phase diagram is generally applicable to membrane-active peptides localized parallel to the membrane surface.},

Ligand-polylysine-mediated gene transfer can be improved up to more than 1000-fold by membrane-active compounds. Other polycations like dendrimers or polyethylenimines as well as several cationic lipids provide a high transfection efficiency per se. Systems based on these polymers or lipids are only slightly enhanced by endosomolytic peptides or adenoviruses. Electroneutral cationic lipid-DNA complexes however can be strongly improved by the addition of membrane-active peptides.},

Incorporation of synthetic membrane-active peptides into delivery systems has been found to enhance intracellular delivery of drugs including oligonucleotides, peptides, or plasmid DNA. In the majority of applications, the amphipathic peptides are designed to act after uptake by endocytosis, releasing the delivered agent from intracellular vesicles to the cytoplasm. Alternatively, peptides might mediate direct drug transfer across the plasma membrane. Although encouraging results have been obtained with the use of synthetic peptides to enhance cellular delivery of various compounds, the naturally evolved mechanisms observed in the entry of viruses or protein toxins are still far more efficient.

Recently, the first X-ray structure of active laccase from white rot fungus Rigidoporus lignosus has been reported containing a full complement of copper ions. Comparison among selected fungal laccases of known 3D structure has shown that the Rigidoporus lignosus laccase has a very high similarity with the Trametes versicolor laccase that, being co-crystallized with 2,5-xylidine, shows a well defined binding pocket for the substrate. Global sequence alignment between Rigidoporus lignosus and Trametes versicolor laccases shows 73{\%} of identity but, surprisingly, there is no identity and neither conservative substitutions between the residues composing the loops directly contacting the 2,5-xylidine. Moreover the structural alignment of these two enzymes identifies in these loops a striking structural similarity proposing the question if 2,5- xylidine may bind in same enzyme pocket. Here we report the protein-ligand docking simulation of 3D structure of Rigidoporus -lignosus laccase and 2,5-xylidine. Docking simulation analyses show that spatial conformation of the two 2,5-xylidine binding pockets, despite differences in the residues directly contacting the ligand, may arrange a similar pocket that allows a comparable accommodation of the inhibitor. To validate these results the binding of 2,5-xylidine in the substrate cavity has been confirmed by kinetic competitive experiments.},

abstract = {Laccases are versatile biocatalysts for the bioremediation of various xenobiotics, including dyes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. However, current sources of new enzymes, simple heterologous expression hosts and enzymatic information (such as the appropriateness of common screening substrates on laccase engineering) remain scarce to support efficient engineering of laccase for better "green" applications. To address the issue, this study began with cloning the laccase family of Lentinula edodes. Three laccases perfectio sensu stricto (Lcc4A, Lcc5, and Lcc7) were then expressed from Pichia pastoris, characterized and compared with the previously reported Lcc1A and Lcc1B in terms of kinetics, stability, and degradation of dyes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Lcc7 represented a novel laccase, and it exhibited both the highest catalytic efficiency (assayed with 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) [ABTS]) and thermostability. However, its performance on "green" applications surprisingly did not match the activity on the common screening substrates, namely, ABTS and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol. On the other hand, correlation analyses revealed that guaiacol is much better associated with the decolorization of multiple structurally different dyes than are the two common screening substrates. Comparison of the oxidation chemistry of guaiacol and phenolic dyes, such as azo dyes, further showed that they both involve generation of phenoxyl radicals in laccase-catalyzed oxidation. In summary, this study concluded a robust expression platform of L. edodes laccases, novel laccases, and an indicative screening substrate, guaiacol, which are all essential fundamentals for appropriately driving the engineering of laccases towards more efficient "green" applications.},

abstract = {In spite of its broad specificity among phenols, Trametes versicolor laccase hardly succeeds in oxidizing hindered substrates. To improve the oxidation ability of this laccase towards bulky phenolic substrates, we designed a series of single-point mutants on the basis of the amino-acid layout inside the reducing substrate active site known from the crystal structure of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis has addressed four phenylalanine residues in key positions 162, 265, 332, and 337 at the entrance of the binding pocket, as these residues appeared instrumental for docking of the substrate. These phenylalanines were replaced by smaller-sized but still apolar alanines. A double mutant F162A/F332A was also designed. Measurement of the oxidation efficiency towards encumbered phenols has shown that mutant F162A was more efficient than the wild-type laccase. The double mutant F162A/F332A led to 98{\%} consumption of bisphenol A in only 5 h and was more efficient than the single mutants in the aerobic oxidation of this bulky substrate. In contrast, lack of appropriate hydrophobic interactions with the substrate possibly depresses the oxidation outcome with mutants F265A and F332A. One explanation for the lack of reactivity of mutant F337A, supported by literature reports, is that this residue is part of the second coordination shell of T1 Cu. A mutation at this position thus leads to a drastic coordination shell destabilization. Thermal stability of the mutants and their resistance in a mixed water-dioxane solvent have also been investigated.},

abstract = {Laccases belong to multicopper oxidases, a widespread class of enzymes implicated in many oxidative functions in various industrial oxidative processes like production of fine chemicals to bioremediation of contaminated soil and water. In order to understand the mechanisms of substrate binding and interaction between substrates and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus laccase, a homology model was generated. The resulted model was further validated and used for docking studies with toxic industrial dyes- acid blue 74, reactive black 5 and reactive blue 19. Interactions of chemical mediators with the laccase was also examined. The docking analysis showed that the active site always cannot accommodate the dye molecules, due to constricted nature of the active site pocket and steric hindrance of the residues whereas mediators are relatively small and can easily be accommodated into the active site pocket, which, thereafter leads to the productive binding. The binding properties of these compounds along with identification of critical active site residues can be used for further site-directed mutagenesis experiments in order to identify their role in activity and substrate specificity, ultimately leading to improved mutants for degradation of these toxic compounds.},

abstract = {Laccase (E.C. 1.10.3.2) is one of the well-studied enzymes used for bioremediation of xenobiotics such as phenols, anilines, etc. Its broad substrate specificity offers a wide opportunity for screening pollutants in order to predict potential targets for degradation. Present study utilizes protein-ligand docking as a tool to achieve the said. For virtual screening, a set of pollutants were selected from five different industries from EPA. X-ray crystal structures of laccase enzymes were taken from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB). Two-dimensional structures of pollutants were downloaded from the NCBI Pubchem, which were further converted into three-dimensional structures using CORINA. Protein-ligand docking was carried out using GOLD. Nearly 30 and 17{\%} of the selected datasets showed the best average GOLD fitness score for fungal and bacterial laccase enzyme respectively, suggesting thereby that laccase might be able to oxidize these pollutants. Moreover, in few cases like anthracene, phenanthrene, etc., there is experimental data to support this hypothesis. Similar kind of work would be helpful to find putative pollutants for other biodegradative enzymes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The BTB domain (also known as the POZ domain) is a versatile protein-protein interaction motif that participates in a wide range of cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation, cytoskeleton dynamics, ion channel assembly and gating, and targeting proteins for ubiquitination. Several BTB domain structures have been experimentally determined, revealing a highly conserved core structure. RESULTS: We surveyed the protein architecture, genomic distribution and sequence conservation of BTB domain proteins in 17 fully sequenced eukaryotes. The BTB domain is typically found as a single copy in proteins that contain only one or two other types of domain, and this defines the BTB-zinc finger (BTB-ZF), BTB-BACK-kelch (BBK), voltage-gated potassium channel T1 (T1-Kv), MATH-BTB, BTB-NPH3 and BTB-BACK-PHR (BBP) families of proteins, among others. In contrast, the Skp1 and ElonginC proteins consist almost exclusively of the core BTB fold. There are numerous lineage-specific expansions of BTB proteins, as seen by the relatively large number of BTB-ZF and BBK proteins in vertebrates, MATH-BTB proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans, and BTB-NPH3 proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using the structural homology between Skp1 and the PLZF BTB homodimer, we present a model of a BTB-Cul3 SCF-like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that shows that the BTB dimer or the T1 tetramer is compatible in this complex. CONCLUSION: Despite widely divergent sequences, the BTB fold is structurally well conserved. The fold has adapted to several different modes of self-association and interactions with non-BTB proteins.},

abstract = {The 5' cap of human messenger RNA contains 2'-O-methylation of the first and often second transcribed nucleotide that is important for its processing, translation and stability. Human enzymes that methylate these nucleotides, termed CMTr1 and CMTr2, respectively, have recently been identified. However, the structures of these enzymes and their mechanisms of action remain unknown. In the present study, we solve the crystal structures of the active CMTr1 catalytic domain in complex with a methyl group donor and a capped oligoribonucleotide, thereby revealing the mechanism of specific recognition of capped RNA. This mechanism differs significantly from viral enzymes, thus providing a framework for their specific targeting. Based on the crystal structure of CMTr1, a comparative model of the CMTr2 catalytic domain is generated. This model, together with mutational analysis, leads to the identification of residues involved in RNA and methyl group donor binding.},

Recent results show that it is a molecular adaptor for substrate recognition by ClpA in Escherichia coli. We analyzed ClpS by bioinformatic methods and found that ClpS homologs are also found in organisms that lack ClpA, such as actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, and plant chloroplasts. Furthermore, ClpS is homologous to a domain in the eukaryotic E3 ubiquitin ligase, N-recognin. This domain has previously been described as responsible for the recognition of type 2 N-end rule substrates. Despite very low levels of sequence similarity to proteins of known structure, there appears to be substantial structural similarity between ClpS and the C-terminal domain of ribosomal protein L7/12 (1CTF).},

abstract = {Methods developed originally to analyze domain motions from simulation [Proteins 27:425-437, 1997] are adapted and extended for the analysis of X-ray conformers and for proteins with more than two domains. The method can be applied as an automatic procedure to any case where more than one conformation is available. The basis of the methodology is that domains can be recognized from the difference in the parameters governing their quasi-rigid body motion, and in particular their rotation vectors. A clustering algorithm is used to determine clusters of rotation vectors corresponding to main-chain segments that form possible dynamic domains. Domains are accepted for further analysis on the basis of a ratio of interdomain to intradomain fluctuation, and Chasles' theorem is used to determine interdomain screw axes. Finally residues involved in the interdomain motion are identified. The methodology is tested on citrate synthase and the M6I mutant of T4 lysozyme. In both cases new aspects to their conformational change are revealed, as are individual residues intimately involved in their dynamics. For citrate synthase the beta sheet is identified to be part of the hinging mechanism. In the case of T4 lysozyme, one of the four transitions in the pathway from the closed to the open conformation, furnished four dynamic domains rather than the expected two. This result indicates that the number of dynamic domains a protein possesses may not be a constant of the motion.},

abstract = {TonB is a protein prevalent in a large number of Gram-negative bacteria that is believed to be responsible for the energy transduction component in the import of ferric iron complexes and vitamin B(12) across the outer membrane. We have analyzed all the TonB proteins that are currently contained in the Entrez database and have identified nine different clusters based on its conserved 90-residue C-terminal domain amino acid sequence. The vast majority of the proteins contained a single predicted cytoplasmic transmembrane domain; however, nine of the TonB proteins encompass a approximately 290 amino acid N-terminal extension homologous to the MecR1 protein, which is composed of three additional predicted transmembrane helices. The periplasmic linker region, which is located between the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain, is extremely variable both in length (22-283 amino acids) and in proline content, indicating that a Pro-rich domain is not a required feature for all TonB proteins. The secondary structure of the C-terminal domain is found to be well preserved across all families, with the most variable region being between the second alpha-helix and the third beta-strand of the antiparallel beta-sheet. The fourth beta-strand found in the solution structure of the Escherichia coli TonB C-terminal domain is not a well conserved feature in TonB proteins in most of the clusters. Interestingly, several of the TonB proteins contained two C-terminal domains in series. This analysis provides a framework for future structure-function studies of TonB, and it draws attention to the unusual features of several TonB proteins.},

abstract = {Understanding the structural basis of altered properties of proteins due to changes in temperature or pH provides useful insights in designing proteins with improved stability. Here we report the basis for the pH-dependent thermostability of the Bacillus subtilis lipase (Lip A) using spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic studies. At pH values above 7, lipase denatures and aggregates when heated at temperatures above 45 degrees C. However, at pH below 6 lipase denatures upon heating but the activity and its native structure is completely recovered upon cooling. In order to obtain the structural basis of this unusual stability of lipase, we determined high-resolution crystal structures of the lipase in two different crystal forms at pH 4.5 and 5. These structures show linear oligomerization of lipase using only two types of dimeric associations and these inter-molecular interactions are completely absent in several crystal forms of wild-type and mutant proteins obtained at basic pH. In accordance with the crystallographic studies, spectroscopic investigations reveal an invariant secondary structure in the pH range of 4-10. Quaternary organization of lipase at low pH resulted in changes in the tryptophan environment and binding of 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfate (ANS) at low pH. Low pH stability of the lipase is not observed in the presence of sodium chloride ({\textgreater}0.2 M) indicating the importance of ionic interactions at low pH. Inter- and intra-molecular ionic interactions that occur at pH below 6.0 are proposed to trap the molecule in a conformation that allows its complete refolding upon cooling.},

Though the M37 lipase is most closely related to the filamentous fungal lipase, Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) at the primary structure level, their activity characteristics are completely different. In an effort to identify structural components of cold adaptation in lipases, we determined the crystal structure of the M37 lipase at 2.2 A resolution and compared it to that of nonadapted RML. Structural analysis revealed that M37 lipase adopted a folding pattern similar to that observed for other lipase structures. However, comparison with RML revealed that the region beneath the lid of the M37 lipase included a significant and unique cavity that would be occupied by a lid helix upon substrate binding. In addition, the oxyanion hole was much wider in M37 lipase than RML. We propose that these distinct structural characteristics of M37 lipase may facilitate the lateral movement of the helical lid and subsequent substrate hydrolysis, which might explain its low activation energy and high activity at low temperatures.},

abstract = {Avian plumage traits are the targets of both natural and sexual selection. Consequently, genetic changes resulting in plumage variation among closely related taxa might represent important evolutionary events. The molecular basis of such differences, however, is unknown in most cases. Sequence variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R) is associated with melanistic phenotypes in many vertebrate taxa, including several avian species. The blue-crowned manakin (Lepidothrix coronata), a widespread, sexually dichromatic passerine, exhibits striking geographic variation in male plumage colour across its range in southern Central America and western Amazonia. Northern males are black with brilliant blue crowns whereas southern males are green with lighter blue crowns. We sequenced 810 bp of the MC1R coding region in 23 individuals spanning the range of male plumage variation. The only variable sites we detected among L. coronata sequences were four synonymous substitutions, none of which were strictly associated with either plumage type. Similarly, comparative analyses showed that L. coronata sequences were monomorphic at the three amino acid sites hypothesized to be functionally important in other birds. These results demonstrate that genes other than MC1R underlie melanic plumage polymorphism in blue-crowned manakins.},

abstract = {The challenge of peptide and peptidomimetic research is the development of methods and techniques to improve the biological properties of native peptides and to convert peptide ligands into non-peptide compounds. Improved biological properties of peptides includes enhancement of stability, potency, and receptor selectivity, for both in vivo and in vitro applications. The design of a ligand with specific activity and desired biological properties is a complex task, and, to accomplish this objective, knowledge about putative interactions between a ligand and the corresponding receptor will be valuable. This includes interactions for both the binding and signal transduction processes. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies involve systematic modification of a lead peptide and are designed to provide insight into potential interactions involved in the formation of the ligand-receptor complex. It is desirable to have knowledge about both favorable and unfavorable processes that may occur in putative ligand-receptor interactions that result in either receptor stimulation or inhibition. Herein, we discuss various SAR studies that have involved melanocortin peptides over three decades and the information these studies have provided to the melanocortin field.},

abstract = {Molecular modeling of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) remains a challenge due to the limited availability of structural information for the receptors. Molecular modeling approaches for melanocortin receptors (MCRs) fall into three categories: structure-based, ligand-based, and proteochemometric. Homology modeling combined with the information obtained from site-directed mutagenesis of receptors, recombined chimeric mutations of receptors and the structures of melanocortin type 4 receptor (MC4R) peptide ligands, has provided insights on detailed ligand-receptor interactions. Still, homology models based on the structures of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) or bovine rhodopsin as templates have not reached atomic level accuracy, making them unsuitable for rational drug design. On the other hand, availability of a large number of potent ligands of MCRs, especially those for the therapeutically important MC4R, has fueled ligand-based approaches, including automated pharmacophore query optimization and pharmacophore-based virtual screening. Proteochemometrics, a novel technology for the analysis of intermolecular interactions between ligand and receptor, has also shown great value in obtaining detailed information on molecular recognition and providing guidance to ligand design. In this review, the strengths and limitations of homology modeling, pharmacophore modeling and proteochemometrics modeling of MCRs are evaluated.},

abstract = {Red hair in humans is associated with variant alleles of the alphaMSH receptor gene, MC1R. Loss of MC1R function in other mammals results in red or yellow hair pigmentation. We show that a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) which contains Mc1r will efficiently rescue loss of Mc1r in transgenic mice, and that overexpression of the receptor suppresses the effect of the endogenous antagonist, agouti protein. We engineered the BAC to replace the mouse coding region with the human MC1R sequence and used this in the transgenic assay. The human receptor also efficiently rescued Mc1r deficiency, and in addition, appeared to be completely resistant to the effects of agouti, suggesting agouti protein may not play a role in human pigmentary variation. Three human variant alleles account for 60{\%} of all cases of red hair. We engineered each of these in turn into the BAC and find that they have reduced, but not completely absent, function in transgenic mice. Comparison of the phenotypes of alphaMSH-deficient mice and humans in conjunction with this data suggests that red hair may not be the null phenotype of MC1R.},

The results of the library screening process are consistent with a hypothesis dating back to the 1980s proposing that a beta-turn conformation involving the melanocortin "Phe-Arg-Trp" core amino acids provides the key recognition element.

abstract = {In a previous article (Zbilut et al., Biophys J 2003;85:3544-3557), we demonstrated how an aggregation versus folding choice could be approached considering hydrophobicity distribution and charge. In this work, our aim is highlighting the mutual interaction of charge and hydrophobicity distribution in the aggregation process. Use was made of two different peptides, both derived from a transmembrane protein (amyloid precursor protein; APP), namely, Abeta(1-28) and Abeta(1-40). Abeta(1-28) has a much lower aggregation propensity than Abeta(1-40). The results obtained by means of molecular dynamics simulations show that, when submitted to the most "aggregation-prone" environment, corresponding to the isoelectric point and consequently to zero net charge, both peptides acquire their maximum flexibility, but Abeta(1-40) has a definitely higher conformational mobility than Abeta(1-28). The absence of a hydrophobic "tail," which is the most mobile part of the molecule in Abeta(1-40), is the element lacking in Abeta(1-28) for obtaining a "fully aggregating" phenotype. Our results suggest that conformational flexibility, determined by both hydrophobicity and charge effect, is the main mechanistic determinant of aggregation propensity.},

abstract = {Computational protein design is a reverse procedure of protein folding and structure prediction, where constructing structures from evolutionarily related proteins has been demonstrated to be the most reliable method for protein 3-dimensional structure prediction. Following this spirit, we developed a novel method to design new protein sequences based on evolutionarily related protein families. For a given target structure, a set of proteins having similar fold are identified from the PDB library by structural alignments. A structural profile is then constructed from the protein templates and used to guide the conformational search of amino acid sequence space, where physicochemical packing is accommodated by single-sequence based solvation, torsion angle, and secondary structure predictions. The method was tested on a computational folding experiment based on a large set of 87 protein structures covering different fold classes, which showed that the evolution-based design significantly enhances the foldability and biological functionality of the designed sequences compared to the traditional physics-based force field methods. Without using homologous proteins, the designed sequences can be folded with an average root-mean-square-deviation of 2.1 {\AA} to the target. As a case study, the method is extended to redesign all 243 structurally resolved proteins in the pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is the second leading cause of death from infectious disease. On a smaller scale, five sequences were randomly selected from the design pool and subjected to experimental validation. The results showed that all the designed proteins are soluble with distinct secondary structure and three have well ordered tertiary structure, as demonstrated by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Together, these results demonstrate a new avenue in computational protein design that uses knowledge of evolutionary conservation from protein structural families to engineer new protein molecules of improved fold stability and biological functionality.},

abstract = {The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) forms a critical switch in the production of orange/red pheomelanin and black/brown eumelanin pigments during hair development in mammals. The molecular evolution of the melanocortin-1 receptor gene was investigated in a broad range of primate species, including several groups with large differences in distribution of orange/red and black hairs. Primate MC1R has been subject to purifying selection throughout most of its evolution, with small changes in selective constraint being detected early in primate evolution. In contrast to the situation in humans and domestic mammals, many intraspecific and intrageneric differences in primate coat color cannot be attributed to changes in the MC1R coding sequence. Nevertheless, important changes in the biochemical function of MC1R are suggested by mutations in sites of known functional importance, particularly in New World monkeys and lemurs. The evolution of the MC1R in lion tamarins is anomalous, with a combination of a high nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS) ratio, deletions, and substitutions.},

In this field, one of the most important nonspecific interactions is the hydrophobic interaction, which is still not fully understood after nearly 30 years of research. To date established hydrophobicity scales, which base mostly on proteins' primary structure, are used to estimate the overall hydrophobicity. The structural complexity and the influence of the protein's environment cannot be accommodated with these scales. In this work, free solution molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the hydrophobic character of low molecular weight peptides. Therefore, local densities of a small hydrophobic tracer molecule and unprotonated triethylamin (TEA) in particular were used to localize and quantify hydrophobic patches among the peptide surface. Comparisons between local densities and the retention behavior in reversed phase chromatography showed significant correlations. Moreover, neighbor effects caused by charges could be identified. We were able to show that the developed in silico method is applicable to characterize peptides in respect to hydrophobicity in agreement with experimental data. We are confident to apply this method to larger protein structures.},

The protein is completely excluded from the hydrophobic SAM but partially dissolves in the hydrophilic SAM. Consequently, the surface of the thiol-terminated SAM is considerably less ordered than that of the methyl-terminated SAM, although a comparable, high degree of order is maintained in the bulk of both SAMs: the chains exhibit collective tilts in the nearest-neighbor direction at angles of 20 degrees and 17 degrees with respect to the surface normal in the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic SAMs, respectively. On the hydrophobic SAM the protein is oriented so that the heme plane is more nearly parallel to the surface, whereas on the hydrophilic surface it is more nearly perpendicular. The secondary structure of the protein, dominated by alpha helices, is not significantly affected, but the structure of the loops as well as the helix packing is slightly modified by the surfaces.},

We present here a comparison of the reorientation dynamics of individual water molecules within the hydration shell of a series of globular proteins: acetylcholinesterase, subtilisin Carlsberg, lysozyme, and ubiquitin. Molecular dynamics simulations and analytical models are used to access site-resolved information on hydration shell dynamics and to elucidate the molecular origins of the dynamical perturbation of hydration shell water relative to bulk water. We show that all four proteins have very similar hydration shell dynamics, despite their wide range of sizes and functions, and differing secondary structures. We demonstrate that this arises from the similar local surface topology and surface chemical composition of the four proteins, and that such local factors alone are sufficient to rationalize the hydration shell dynamics. We propose that these conclusions can be generalized to a wide range of globular proteins. We also show that protein conformational fluctuations induce a dynamical heterogeneity within the hydration layer. We finally address the effect of confinement on hydration shell dynamics via a site-resolved analysis and connect our results to experiments via the calculation of two-dimensional infrared spectra.},

abstract = {We have designed a model protein that consists of two identical 35-residue polypeptide chains, parallel and in-register arranged in a two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. This structure is stabilized by interchain hydrophobic interactions between leucine residues at positions "a" and "d" of a repeating heptad sequence. To determine the positional effects of interchain hydrophobic interactions on the stability of the coiled-coil, a single leucine residue in each chain at position "a" (9, 16, 23, 30) and "d" (5, 12, 19, 26, 33) was systematically replaced by an alanine. All these proteins formed two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coils in benign conditions (0.05 M phosphate, 0.1 M KCl, pH 7). The stability of each mutant protein was determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation experiments, where the decrease in ellipticity at 220 nm was monitored by circular dichroism. The single alanine replacements of a leucine residue at hydrophobic positions a and/or d are all shown to destabilize the coiled-coil structure. The non-equivalent hydrophobic positions a and d make an equivalent contribution to protein stability along the majority of the coiled-coil structure (positions 9-30). The small decrease in coiled-coil stability caused by Leu----Ala substitution at either ends of the coiled-coil suggested that the Leu-Leu hydrophobic interactions are less important at the ends of the coiled-coil and the ends of the coiled-coil are more flexible. Analysis of the difference between the ellipticity in benign buffer and in 50{\%} trifluoroethanol (delta theta 220) and the slope term from a plot of the free energy of unfolding versus guanidine hydrochloride concentration also supported the conclusion that the leucine residues at the ends of the coiled-coil are much less buried than in the middle section of the coiled-coil.},

abstract = {Aqueous polymer two-phase system provides a powerful method for separation and purification of biomaterials. Among various factors, polymer concentration and polymer molecular weight are essential and have strong impact on the protein partitioning in these systems. Based on the modified Pitzer's model, a simple expression has been obtained for correlating protein partitioning in aqueous polymer two-phase systems with varying polymer concentration and different polymer molecular weights. Using only one group of parameters for each target protein, the partition coefficients of five proteins (lysozyme, chymotrypsinogen-A, bovine serum albumin, transferrin and catalase) in 16 sets of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/dextran systems were correlated. In addition, partition behavior of lactate dehydrogenase in PEG/hydroxypropyl starch systems were measured, correlated and partially predicted. A comparison of calculated and experimental data indicated that the model provides good correlation and prediction abilities on the protein partitioning in aqueous polymer two-phase systems with a wide range of polymer concentration and molecular weight. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Correlations to describe the effect of surface hydrophobicity and charge of proteins with their partition coefficient in aqueous two-phase systems were investigated. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000/phosphate, sulfate, citrate, and dextran systems in the presence of low (0.6{\%} w/w) and high (8.8{\%} w/w) levels of NaCl were selected for a systematic study of 12 proteins. The surface hydrophobicity of the proteins was measured by ammonium sulfate precipitation as the inverse of their solubility. The hydrophobicity values measured correlated well with the partition coefficients, K, obtained in the PEG/salt systems at high concentration of NaCl (r = 0.92-0.93). In PEG/citrate systems the partition coefficient correlated well with protein hydrophobicity at low and high concentrations of NaCl (r = 0.81 and 0.93, respectively). The PEG/citrate system also had a higher hydrophobic resolution than other systems to exploit differences in the protein's hydrophobicity. The surface charge and charge density of the proteins was determined over a range of pH (3-9) by electrophoretic titration curves; PEG/salt systems did not discriminate well between proteins of different charge or charge density. In the absence of NaCl, K decreased slightly with increased positive charge. At high NaCl concentration, K increased as a function of positive charge. This suggested that the PEG-rich top phase became more negative as the concentration of NaCl in the systems increased and, therefore, attracted the positively charged proteins. The effect of charge was more important in PEG/dextran systems at low concentrations of NaCl. In the PEG/dextran systems at lower concentration of NaCl, molecular weight appeared to be the prime determinant of partition, whereas no clear effect of molecular weight could be found in PEG/salt systems.},

@article{Corso2012,
abstract = {In reptiles, dorsal body darkness often varies with substrate color or temperature environment, and is generally presumed to be an adaptation for crypsis or thermoregulation. However, the genetic basis of pigmentation is poorly known in this group. In this study we analyzed the coding region of the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene, and therefore its role underlying the dorsal color variation in two sympatric species of sand lizards (Liolaemus) that inhabit the southeastern coast of South America: L. occipitalis and L. arambarensis. The first is light-colored and occupies aeolic pale sand dunes, while the second is brownish and lives in a darker sandy habitat. We sequenced 630 base pairs of MC1R in both species. In total, 12 nucleotide polymorphisms were observed, and four amino acid replacement sites, but none of them could be associated with a color pattern. Comparative analysis indicated that these taxa are monomorphic for amino acid sites that were previously identified as functionally important in other reptiles. Thus, our results indicate that MC1R is not involved in the pigmentation pattern observed in Liolaemus lizards. Therefore, structural differences in other genes, such as ASIP, or variation in regulatory regions of MC1R may be responsible for this variation. Alternatively, the phenotypic differences observed might be a consequence of non-genetic factors, such as thermoregulatory mechanisms.},

abstract = {We report a Molecular Dynamics (MD) study of the interface between water and the hygroscopic room temperature Ionic Liquid "IL" [BMI][PF6] (1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate), comparing the TIP3P, SPC/E and TIP5P models for water and two IL models where the ions are +/-1 or +/-0.9 charged. A recent MD study (A. Chaumont, R. Schurhammer and G. Wipff, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2005, 109, 18964) showed that using TIP3P water in conjunction with the IL(+/-1) model led to water-IL mixing without forming an interface, whereas a biphasic system could be obtained with the IL(+/-0.9) model. With the TIP5P and SPC/E models, the juxtaposed aqueous and IL phases are found to remain distinct for at least 20 ns. The resulting IL humidity, exaggerated with the IL(+/-1) model, is in better agreement with experiment using the IL(+/-0.9) model. We also report demixing simulations on the "randomly mixed" liquids, using the IL(+/-0.9) model for the ionic liquid. With the three tested water models, the phases separate very slowly ( approximately 20 ns or more) compared to "classical" chloroform-water mixtures (less than 1 ns), leading to biphasic systems similar to those obtained after equilibration of the juxtaposed liquids. The characteristics of the interface (size, polarity, ion orientation, electrostatic potential) are compared with the different models. Possible reasons why, among the three tested water models, the widely-used TIP3P model exaggerates the inter-solvent mixing, are analyzed. The difficulty in computationally and experimentally equilibrating water-IL mixtures is attributed to the slow dynamics and micro-heterogeneity of the IL and to the different states of water in the IL phase.},

abstract = {We report molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the aqueous interface of the hydrophobic [BMI][Tf2N] ionic liquid (IL), composed of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cations (BMI+) and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anions (Tf2N-). The questions of water/IL phase separation and properties of the neat interface are addressed, comparing different liquid models (TIP3P vs TIP5P water and +1.0/-1.0 vs +0.9/-0.9 charged IL ions), the Ewald vs the reaction field treatments of the long range electrostatics, and different starting conditions. With the different models, the "randomly" mixed liquids separate much more slowly (in 20 to 40 ns) than classical water-oil mixtures do (typically, in less than 1 ns), finally leading to distinct nanoscopic phases separated by an interface, as in simulations which started with a preformed interface, but the IL phase is more humid. The final state of water in the IL thus depends on the protocol and relates to IL heterogeneities and viscosity. Water mainly fluctuates in hydrophilic basins (rich in O(Tf2N) and aromatic CH(BMI) groups), separated by more hydrophobic domains (rich in CF3(Tf2N) and alkyl(BMI) groups), in the form of monomers and dimers in the weakly humid IL phase, and as higher aggregates when the IL phase is more humid. There is more water in the IL than IL in water, to different extents, depending on the model. The interface is sharper and narrower (approximately 10 A) than with the less hydrophobic [BMI][PF6] IL and is overall neutral, with isotropically oriented molecules, as in the bulk phases. The results allow us to better understand the analogies and differences of aqueous interfaces with hydrophobic (but hygroscopic) ILs, compared to classical organic liquids.},

In this study we examine the folding of a series of three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets known as WW domains. Whereas other WW domains have been shown to fold with single-exponential kinetics, the WW domain from murine formin-binding protein 28 has recently been shown to fold with biphasic kinetics. By using a combination of kinetics and thermodynamics to characterize a simple model for this protein, the origins of the biphasic kinetics is found to lie in the fact that most of the protein is able to fold without requiring one of the beta-hairpins to be correctly registered. The correct register of this hairpin is enforced by a surface-exposed hydrophobic contact, which is not present in other WW domains. This finding suggests the use of judiciously chosen surface-exposed hydrophobic pairs as a protein design strategy for enforcing the desired strand registry.},

abstract = {Protein surface hydration is fundamental to its structural stability and flexibility, and water-protein fluctuations are essential to biological function. Here, we report a systematic global mapping of water motions in the hydration layer around a model protein of apomyoglobin in both native and molten globule states. With site-directed mutagenesis, we use intrinsic tryptophan as a local optical probe to scan the protein surface one at a time with single-site specificity. With femtosecond resolution, we examined 16 mutants in two states and observed two types of water-network relaxation with distinct energy and time distributions. The first water motion results from the local collective hydrogen-bond network relaxation and occurs in a few picoseconds. The initial hindered motions, observed in bulk water in femtoseconds, are highly suppressed and drastically slow down due to structured water-network collectivity in the layer. The second water-network relaxation unambiguously results from the lateral cooperative rearrangements in the inner hydration shell and occurs in tens to hundreds of picoseconds. Significantly, this longtime dynamics is the coupled interfacial water-protein motions and is the direct measurement of such cooperative fluctuations. These local protein motions, although highly constrained, are necessary to assist the longtime water-network relaxation. A series of correlations of hydrating water dynamics and coupled fluctuations with local protein's chemical and structural properties were observed. These results are significant and reveal various water behaviors in the hydration layer with wide heterogeneity. We defined a solvation speed and an angular speed to quantify the water-network rigidity and local protein flexibility, respectively. We also observed that the dynamic hydration layer extends to more than 10 A. Finally, from native to molten globule states, the hydration water networks loosen up, and the protein locally becomes more flexible with larger global plasticity and partial unfolding.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are being applied to increasingly complex systems, including those involving small endogenous compounds and drug molecules. In order to obtain meaningful and accurate data from these simulations, high-quality topologies for small molecules must be generated in a manner that is consistent with the derivation of the force field applied to the system. Often, force fields are designed for use with macromolecules such as proteins, making their transferability to other species challenging. Investigators are increasingly attracted to automated topology generation programs, although the quality of the resulting topologies remains unknown. Here we assess the applicability of the popular PRODRG server that generates small-molecule topologies for use with the GROMOS family of force fields. We find that PRODRG does not reproduce topologies for even the most well-characterized species in the force field due to inconsistent charges and charge groups. We assessed the effects of PRODRG-derived charges on several systems: pure liquids, amino acids at a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, and an enzyme-cofactor complex. We found that partial atomic charges generated by PRODRG are largely incompatible with GROMOS force fields, and the behavior of these systems deviates substantially from that of simulations using GROMOS parameters. We conclude by proposing several points as "best practices" for parametrization of small molecules under the GROMOS force fields.},

abstract = {Two neuropeptides, substance P (SP) and SP-tyrosine-8 (SP-Y8), have been studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in a TIP3P water/CCl4 biphasic solvent system as a mimic for the water-membrane system. Initially, distance restraints derived from NMR nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOE) were incorporated in the restrained MD (RMD) in the equilibration stage of the simulation. The starting orientation/position of the peptides for the MD simulation was either parallel to the water/CCl4 interface or in a perpendicular/insertion mode. In both cases the peptides equilibrated and adopted a near-parallel orientation within approximately 250 ps. After equilibration, the conformation and orientation of the peptides, the solvation of both the backbone and the side chain of the residues, hydrogen bonding, and the dynamics of the peptides were analyzed from trajectories obtained in the RMD or the subsequent free MD (where the NOE restraints were removed). These analyses showed that the peptide backbone of nearly all residues are either solvated by water or are hydrogen-bonded. This is seen to be an important factor against the insertion mode of interaction. Most of the interactions with the hydrophobic phase come from the hydrophobic interactions of the side chains of Pro-4, Phe-7, Phe-8, Leu-10, and Met-11 for SP, and Phe-7, Leu-10, Met-11 and, to a lesser extent, Tyr-8 in SP-Y8. Concerted conformational transitions took place in the time frame of hundreds of picoseconds. The concertedness of the transition was due to the tendency of the peptide to maintain the necessary secondary structure to position the peptide properly with respect to the water/CCl4 interface.},

abstract = {To probe the fundamentals of membrane/protein interactions, all-atom multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on a single transmembrane poly(32)alanine helix in a fully solvated dimyristoyphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer. The central 12 residues, which interact only with the lipid hydrocarbon chains, maintained a very stable helical structure. Helical regions extended beyond these central 12 residues, but interactions with the lipid fatty-acyl ester linkages, the lipid headgroups, and water molecules made the helix less stable in this region. The C and N termini, exposed largely to water, existed as random coils. As a whole, the helix tilted substantially, from perpendicular to the bilayer plane (0 degree) to a 30 degrees tilt. The helix experienced a bend at its middle, and the two halves of the helix at times assumed substantially different tilts. Frequent hydrogen bonding, of up to 0.7 ns in duration, occurred between peptide and lipid molecules. This resulted in correlated translational diffusion between the helix and a few lipid molecules. Because of the large variation in lipid conformation, the lipid environment of the peptide was not well defined in terms of "annular" lipids and on average consisted of 18 lipid molecules. When compared with a "neat" bilayer without peptide, no significant difference was seen in the bilayer thickness, lipid conformations or diffusion, or headgroup orientation. However, the lipid hydrocarbon chain order parameters showed a significant decrease in order, especially in those methylene groups closest to the headgroup.},

abstract = {Discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) is a rapid sampling method used in protein folding and aggregation studies. Until now, DMD was used to perform simulations of simplified protein models in conjunction with structure-based force fields. Here, we develop an all-atom protein model and a transferable force field featuring packing, solvation, and environment-dependent hydrogen bond interactions. We performed folding simulations of six small proteins (20-60 residues) with distinct native structures by the replica exchange method. In all cases, native or near-native states were reached in simulations. For three small proteins, multiple folding transitions are observed, and the computationally characterized thermodynamics are in qualitative agreement with experiments. The predictive power of all-atom DMD highlights the importance of environment-dependent hydrogen bond interactions in modeling protein folding. The developed approach can be used for accurate and rapid sampling of conformational spaces of proteins and protein-protein complexes and applied to protein engineering and design of protein-protein interactions.},

In genetic crosses, allelic variation at Mc1r explains 9.8{\%} to 36.4{\%} of the variation in seven pigmentation traits determining color pattern. The derived Mc1r allele is present in Florida's Gulf Coast beach mice but not in Atlantic coast mice with similar light coloration, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms are responsible for convergent phenotypic evolution.

abstract = {Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) refers to a heterogeneous group of inherited diseases that result in progressive retinal degeneration, characterized by visual field constriction and night blindness. A total of 103 mutations in rhodopsin are linked to RP to date, and the phenotypes range from severe to asymptomatic. To study the relation between phenotype and rhodopsin stability in disease mutants, we used a structure-based approach. For 12 of the mutants located at the protein-lipid interphase, we used the von Heijne water-membrane transfer scale, and we find that 9 of the mutations could affect membrane insertion. For 91 mutants, we used the protein design algorithm FoldX. The 3 asymptomatic mutations had no significant reduced stability, 2 were unsuitable for FoldX analysis since the structure was incorrect in this region, 63 mutations had a significant change in protein stability ({\textgreater}1.6 kcal/mol), and 23 mutations had energy change values under the prediction error threshold ({\textless}1.6 kcal/mol). Out of these 23, the disease-causing effect could be explained by the involvement in other functions (e.g., glycosylation motifs, the interface with arrestin and transducin, and the cilia-binding motif) for 19 mutants. The remaining 4 mutants were probably incorrectly associated with RP or have functionalities not discovered yet. For destabilizing mutations where clinical data were available, we found a highly significant correlation between FoldX energy changes and the average age of night blindness and between FoldX energy changes and daytime vision loss onset. Our detailed structural, functional, and energetic analysis provides a complete picture of the rhodopsin mutations and can guide mutation-specific therapies.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of protein stability changes resulting from single amino acid mutations is important for understanding protein structures and designing new proteins. We use support vector machines to predict protein stability changes for single amino acid mutations leveraging both sequence and structural information. We evaluate our approach using cross-validation methods on a large dataset of single amino acid mutations. When only the sign of the stability changes is considered, the predictive method achieves 84{\%} accuracy-a significant improvement over previously published results. Moreover, the experimental results show that the prediction accuracy obtained using sequence alone is close to the accuracy obtained using tertiary structure information. Because our method can accurately predict protein stability changes using primary sequence information only, it is applicable to many situations where the tertiary structure is unknown, overcoming a major limitation of previous methods which require tertiary information. The web server for predictions of protein stability changes upon mutations (MUpro), software, and datasets are available at http://www.igb.uci.edu/servers/servers.html.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rational design of modified proteins with controlled stability is of extreme importance in a whole range of applications, notably in the biotechnological and environmental areas, where proteins are used for their catalytic or other functional activities. Future breakthroughs in medical research may also be expected from an improved understanding of the effect of naturally occurring disease-causing mutations on the molecular level. RESULTS: PoPMuSiC-2.1 is a web server that predicts the thermodynamic stability changes caused by single site mutations in proteins, using a linear combination of statistical potentials whose coefficients depend on the solvent accessibility of the mutated residue. PoPMuSiC presents good prediction performances (correlation coefficient of 0.8 between predicted and measured stability changes, in cross validation, after exclusion of 10{\%} outliers). It is moreover very fast, allowing the prediction of the stability changes resulting from all possible mutations in a medium size protein in less than a minute. This unique functionality is user-friendly implemented in PoPMuSiC and is particularly easy to exploit. Another new functionality of our server concerns the estimation of the optimality of each amino acid in the sequence, with respect to the stability of the structure. It may be used to detect structural weaknesses, i.e. clusters of non-optimal residues, which represent particularly interesting sites for introducing targeted mutations. This sequence optimality data is also expected to have significant implications in the prediction and the analysis of particular structural or functional protein regions. To illustrate the interest of this new functionality, we apply it to a dataset of known catalytic sites, and show that a much larger than average concentration of structural weaknesses is detected, quantifying how these sites have been optimized for function rather than stability. CONCLUSION: The freely available PoPMuSiC-2.1 web server is highly useful for identifying very rapidly a list of possibly relevant mutations with the desired stability properties, on which subsequent experimental studies can be focused. It can also be used to detect sequence regions corresponding to structural weaknesses, which could be functionally important or structurally delicate regions, with obvious applications in rational protein design.},

abstract = {Cholesterol plays an important role in maintaining the correct fluidity and rigidity of the plasma membrane of all animal cells, and hence, it is present in concentrations ranging from 20 to 50 mol {\%}. Whereas the effect of cholesterol on such mechanical properties has been studied exhaustively over the last decades, the structural basis for cholesterol effects on membrane permeability is still unclear. Here we apply systematic molecular dynamics simulations to study the partitioning of solutes between water and membranes. We derive potentials of mean force for six different solutes permeating across 20 different lipid membranes containing one out of four types of phospholipids plus a cholesterol content varying from 0 to 50 mol {\%}. Surprisingly, cholesterol decreases solute partitioning into the lipid tail region of the membranes much more strongly than expected from experiments on macroscopic membranes, suggesting that a laterally inhomogeneous cholesterol concentration and permeability may be required to explain experimental findings. The simulations indicate that the cost of breaking van der Waals interactions between the lipid tails of cholesterol-containing membranes account for the reduced partitioning rather than the surface area per phospholipid, which has been frequently suggested as a determinant for solute partitioning. The simulations further show that the partitioning is more sensitive to cholesterol (i) for larger solutes, (ii) in membranes with saturated as compared to membranes with unsaturated lipid tails, and (iii) in membranes with smaller lipid head groups.},

abstract = {Immobilization of enzymes may produce alterations in their observed activity, specificity or selectivity. Although in many cases an impoverishment of the enzyme properties is observed upon immobilization (caused by the distortion of the enzyme due to the interaction with the support) in some instances such properties may be enhanced by this immobilization. These alterations in enzyme properties are sometimes associated with changes in the enzyme structure. Occasionally, these variations will be positive. For example, they may be related to the stabilization of a hyperactivated form of the enzyme, like in the case of lipases immobilized on hydrophobic supports via interfacial activation. In some other instances, these improvements will be just a consequence of random modifications in the enzyme properties that in some reactions will be positive while in others may be negative. For this reason, the preparation of a library of biocatalysts as broad as possible may be a key turning point to find an immobilized biocatalyst with improved properties when compared to the free enzyme. Immobilized enzymes will be dispersed on the support surface and aggregation will no longer be possible, while the free enzyme may suffer aggregation, which greatly decreases enzyme activity. Moreover, enzyme rigidification may lead to preservation of the enzyme properties under drastic conditions in which the enzyme tends to become distorted thus decreasing its activity. Furthermore, immobilization of enzymes on a support, mainly on a porous support, may in many cases also have a positive impact on the observed enzyme behavior, not really related to structural changes. For example, the promotion of diffusional problems (e.g., pH gradients, substrate or product gradients), partition (towards or away from the enzyme environment, for substrate or products), or the blocking of some areas (e.g., reducing inhibitions) may greatly improve enzyme performance. Thus, in this tutorial review, we will try to list and explain some of the main reasons that may produce an improvement in enzyme activity, specificity or selectivity, either real or apparent, due to immobilization.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Estimating a phenotype distribution conditional on a set of discrete-valued predictors is a commonly encountered task. For example, interest may be in how the density of a quantitative trait varies with single nucleotide polymorphisms and patient characteristics. The subset of important predictors is not usually known in advance. This becomes more challenging with a high-dimensional predictor set when there is the possibility of interaction.

RESULTS: We demonstrate a novel non-parametric Bayes method based on a tensor factorization of predictor-dependent weights for Gaussian kernels. The method uses multistage predictor selection for dimension reduction, providing succinct models for the phenotype distribution. The resulting conditional density morphs flexibly with the selected predictors. In a simulation study and an application to molecular epidemiology data, we demonstrate advantages over commonly used methods.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: To assess whether two proteins will interact under physiological conditions, information on the interaction free energy is needed. Statistical learning techniques and docking methods for predicting protein-protein interactions cannot quantitatively estimate binding free energies. Full atomistic molecular simulation methods do have this potential, but are completely unfeasible for large-scale applications in terms of computational cost required. Here we investigate whether applying coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations is a viable alternative for complexes of known structure.

RESULTS: We calculate the free energy barrier with respect to the bound state based on molecular dynamics simulations using both a full atomistic and a CG force field for the TCR-pMHC complex and the MP1-p14 scaffolding complex. We find that the free energy barriers from the CG simulations are of similar accuracy as those from the full atomistic ones, while achieving a speedup of {\textgreater}500-fold. We also observe that extensive sampling is extremely important to obtain accurate free energy barriers, which is only within reach for the CG models. Finally, we show that the CG model preserves biological relevance of the interactions: (i) we observe a strong correlation between evolutionary likelihood of mutations and the impact on the free energy barrier with respect to the bound state; and (ii) we confirm the dominant role of the interface core in these interactions. Therefore, our results suggest that CG molecular simulations can realistically be used for the accurate prediction of protein-protein interaction strength.

@article{Boman1993,
abstract = {Cecropin P1 and PR-39 are two antibacterial peptides isolated from the upper part of the small intestine of the pig. They have been sequenced, and their antibacterial spectra have been investigated (J.-Y. Lee, A. Boman, C. Sun, M. Andersson, H. J{\"{o}}rnvall, V. Mutt, and H. G. Boman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:9159-9162, 1989; B. Agerberth, J.-Y. Lee, T. Bergman, M. Carlquist, H. G. Boman, V. Mutt, and H. J{\"{o}}rnvall, Eur. J. Biochem. 202:849-854, 1991). We have now compared these two peptides for their mechanism of action on Escherichia coli K-12 by using three strains with different markers. Our results show that cecropin P1, like other cecropins, kills bacteria by lysis and that this reaction requires more peptide to kill more cells. PR-39 requires a lag period of about 8 min to penetrate the outer membrane of wild-type E. coli; then killing is quite fast. This lag period was absent in the envA1 mutant; in this strain the outer membrane was freely permeable to both peptides. PR-39 killed growing bacteria faster than nongrowing cells; for cecropin P1 there was no such difference. It is suggested from isotope incorporation experiments that PR-39 kills bacteria by a mechanism that stops protein and DNA synthesis and results in degradation of these components.},

@article{Ben-Tal1996,
abstract = {We measured directly the binding of Lys3, Lys5, and Lys7 to vesicles containing acidic phospholipids. When the vesicles contain 33{\%} acidic lipids and the aqueous solution contains 100 mM monovalent salt, the standard Gibbs free energy for the binding of these peptides is 3, 5, and 7 kcal/mol, respectively. The binding energies decrease as the mol{\%} of acidic lipids in the membrane decreases and/or as the salt concentration increases. Several lines of evidence suggest that these hydrophilic peptides do not penetrate the polar headgroup region of the membrane and that the binding is mainly due to electrostatic interactions. To calculate the binding energies from classical electrostatics, we applied the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation to atomic models of the phospholipid bilayers and the basic peptides in aqueous solution. The electrostatic free energy of interaction, which arises from both a long-range coulombic attraction between the positively charged peptide and the negatively charged lipid bilayer, and a short-range Born or image charge repulsion, is a minimum when approximately 2.5 A (i.e., one layer of water) exists between the van der Waals surfaces of the peptide and the lipid bilayer. The calculated molar association constants, K, agree well with the measured values: K is typically about 10-fold smaller than the experimental value (i.e., a difference of about 1.5 kcal/mol in the free energy of binding). The predicted dependence of K (or the binding free energies) on the ionic strength of the solution, the mol{\%} of acidic lipids in the membrane, and the number of basic residues in the peptide agree very well with the experimental measurements. These calculations are relevant to the membrane binding of a number of important proteins that contain clusters of basic residues.},

abstract = {Charged amino acids are known to be important in controlling the actions of integral and peripheral membrane proteins and cell disrupting peptides. Atomistic molecular dynamics studies have shed much light on the mechanisms of membrane binding and translocation of charged protein groups, yet the impact of the full diversity of membrane physico-chemical properties and topologies has yet to be explored. Here we have performed a systematic study of an arginine (Arg) side chain analog moving across saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers of variable hydrocarbon tail length from 10 to 18 carbons. For all bilayers we observe similar ion-induced defects, where Arg draws water molecules and lipid head groups into the bilayers to avoid large dehydration energy costs. The free energy profiles all exhibit sharp climbs with increasing penetration into the hydrocarbon core, with predictable shifts between bilayers of different thickness, leading to barrier reduction from 26 kcal/mol for 18 carbons to 6 kcal/mol for 10 carbons. For lipids of 10 and 12 carbons we observe narrow transmembrane pores and corresponding plateaus in the free energy profiles. Allowing for movements of the protein and side chain snorkeling, we argue that the energetic cost for burying Arg inside a thin bilayer will be small, consistent with recent experiments, also leading to a dramatic reduction in pK(a) shifts for Arg. We provide evidence that Arg translocation occurs via an ion-induced defect mechanism, except in thick bilayers (of at least 18 carbons) where solubility-diffusion becomes energetically favored. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms of ion movement through membranes of varying composition, with implications for a range of charged protein-lipid interactions and the actions of cell-perturbing peptides.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls are one of the most common medical complications after stroke with a reported incidence of 7{\%} in the first week after stroke onset. Studies investigating falls in the later phase after stroke report an incidence of up to 73{\%} in the first year post-stroke. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing falls in people after stroke. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (November 2012) and the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group (May 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5, MEDLINE (1950 to May 2012), EMBASE (1980 to May 2012), CINAHL (1982 to May 2012), PsycINFO (1806 to May 2012), AMED (1985 to May 2012) and PEDro (May 2012). We also searched trials registers, checked reference lists and contacted authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of interventions where the primary or secondary aim was to prevent falls in people after stroke. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We used a rate ratio and 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) to compare the rate of falls (e.g. falls per person year) between intervention and control groups. For risk of falling we used a risk ratio and 95{\%} CI based on the number of people falling (fallers) in each group. We pooled results where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies with a total of 1004 participants. One study evaluated the effect of exercises in the acute and subacute phase after stroke but found no significant difference in rate of falls (rate ratio 0.92, 95{\%} CI 0.45 to 1.90, 95 participants). The pooled result of four studies investigating the effect of exercises on preventing falls in the chronic phase also found no significant difference for rate of falls (rate ratio 0.75, 95{\%} CI 0.41 to 1.38, 412 participants).For number of fallers, one study examined the effect of exercises in the acute and subacute phase after stroke but found no significant difference between the intervention and control group (risk ratio 1.19, 95{\%} CI 0.83 to 1.71, 95 participants). The pooled result of six studies examining the effect of exercises in the chronic phase also found no significant difference in number of fallers between the intervention and control groups (risk ratio 1.02, 95{\%} CI 0.83 to 1.24, 616 participants).The rate of falls and the number of fallers was significantly reduced in two studies evaluating the effect of medication on preventing falls; one study (85 participants) compared vitamin D versus placebo in institutionalised women after stroke with low vitamin D levels, and the other study (79 participants) evaluated alendronate versus alphacalcidol in hospitalised people after stroke.One study provided single lens distance glasses to regular wearers of multifocal glasses. In a subgroup of 46 participants post-stroke there was no significant difference in the rate of falls (rate ratio 1.08, 95{\%} CI 0.52 to 2.25) or the number of fallers between both groups (risk ratio 0.74, 95{\%} CI 0.47 to 1.18). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence that exercises or prescription of single lens glasses to multifocal users prevent falls or decrease the number of people falling after being discharged from rehabilitation following their stroke. Two studies testing vitamin D versus placebo and alendronate versus alphacalcidol found a significant reduction in falls and the number of people falling. However, these findings should be replicated before the results are implemented in clinical practice.},

Our aim was to evaluate whether balance exercises performed under various sensory input manipulations can improve postural stability and/or walking ability in patients with stroke. Seven chronic hemiparetic subjects were recruited. Patient performance was assessed before, immediately after and one week after treatment (consisting of 20 one-hour daily sessions of several balance exercises) by means of the Sensory Organization Balance Test and the Ten Metre Walking Test. Before treatment, all patients showed balance impairment with difficulty integrating somatosensory information from the lower extremities and excessive reliance upon visual input in standing balance control. After treatment, balance and walking speed significantly increased and this improvement was maintained for one week. These findings indicate that rehabilitation of sensorimotor integration deficits can improve balance in patients with stroke hemiparesis.},

abstract = {To obtain an indication of the tendencies of amino acids to leave water and enter a truly nonpolar condensed phase, distribution coefficients between dilute solution in water and dilute solution in wet cyclohexane have been determined for each of the common amino acid side chains a t pH 7; they are found to be closely related to the inside-outside distributions of the side chains observed in globular proteins. There was no evidence that excess water enters cyclohexane in association with these solutes. Cyclohexane-to-water distribution coefficients can be combined with vapor-to-water distribution coefficients reported earlier to yield vapor-to-cyclohexane distribution coefficients. Vapor-to-cyclohexane distribution coefficients provide an experimental index of susceptibility to attraction by dispersion forces, and the corresponding free energies are found to be linearly related to side-chain surface areas. Observations using different solvents and variously substituted side chains suggest that alcohols such as 1-octanol exert a specific attraction on the side chain of tryptophan. When less polar phases are used as a reference, leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and methionine are found to be more hydrophobic than tryptophan.},

abstract = {Periodicities in the polar/apolar character of the amino acid sequence of a protein can be examined by assigning to each residue a numerical hydrophobicity and searching for periodicity in the resulting one-dimensional function. The strength of each periodic component is the quantity that has been termed the hydrophobic moment. When proteins of known three-dimensional structure are examined, it is found that sequences that form alpha helices tend to have, on average, a strong periodicity in the hydrophobicity of 3.6 residues, the period of the alpha helix. Similarly, many sequences that form strands of beta sheets tend to have a periodicity in their hydrophobicity of about 2.3 residues, the period typical of beta structure. Also, the few sequences known to form 3(10) helices display a periodicity of about 2.5 residues, not far from the period of 3 for an ideal 3(10) helix. This means that many protein sequences tend to form the periodic structure that maximizes their amphiphilicity. This observation suggests that the periodicity of the hydrophobicity of the protein primary structure is a factor in the formation of secondary structures. Moreover, the observation that many protein sequences tend to form segments of maximum amphiphilicity suggests that segments of secondary structure fold at a hydrophobic surface, probably formed from other parts of the folding protein.},

abstract = {Antibacterial peptides are the effector molecules of innate immunity. Generally they contain 15-45 amino acid residues and the net charge is positive. The cecropin type of linear peptides without cysteine were found first in insects, whilst the defensin type with three disulphide bridges were found in rabbit granulocytes. Now a database stores more than 800 sequences of antibacterial peptides and proteins from the animal and plant kingdoms. Generally, each species has 15-40 peptides made from genes, which code for only one precursor. The dominating targets are bacterial membranes and the killing reaction must be faster than the growth rate of the bacteria. Some antibacterial peptides are clearly multifunctional and an attempt to predict this property from the hydrophobicity of all amino acid side chains are given. Gene structures and biosynthesis are known both in the fruit fly Drosophila and several mammals. Humans need two classes of defensins and the cathelicidin-derived linear peptide LL-37. Clinical cases show that deficiencies in these peptides give severe symptoms. Examples given are morbus Kostmann and atopic allergy. Several antibacterial peptides are being developed as drugs.},

The major goal of this study is to characterize easily calculated molecular properties, which quantitatively show high correlation with antibacterial activity. The peptides studied have high sequence similarity but vary in activity over more than an order of magnitude. Hence, sequence analysis alone cannot be used to predict activity for these peptides. We calculate structural properties of 62 protegrin and protegrin-analogue peptides and correlate them to experimental activities against six microbe species, as well as hemolytic and cytotoxic activities. Natural protegrins structures were compared with synthetic derivatives using homology modeling, and property descriptors were calculated to determine the characteristics that confer their antimicrobial activity. A structure-activity relationship study of all these peptides provides information about the structural properties that affect activity against different microbial species.},

Circular dichroism studies, performed comparatively with alamethicin, in small or large unilamellar phospholipidic vesicles, point to a smaller proportion of alpha-helical conformation in membranes. A weakly voltage-dependent macroscopic conductance which is anion-selective is developed when using large aqueous peptide concentration with lipid bilayer under high voltages. Single-channel experiments revealed two main conductance levels occurring independently in separate trials. Pre-aggregates lying on the membrane surface at rest and drawn into the bilayer upon voltage application are assumed to account for this behaviour contrasting with the classical multistates displayed by alamethicin.},

@article{Hawrani2008,
abstract = {We recently described a novel antimicrobial peptide, RTA3, derived from the commensal organism Streptococcus mitis, with strong anti-Gram-negative activity, low salt sensitivity, and minimal mammalian cell toxicity in vitro and in vivo. This peptide conforms to the positively charged, amphipathic helical peptide motif, but has a positively charged amino acid (Arg-5) on the nonpolar face of the helical structure that is induced upon membrane binding. We surmised that disruption of the hydrophobic face with a positively charged residue plays a role in minimizing eukaryotic cell toxicity, and we tested this using a mutant with an R5L substitution. The greatly enhanced toxicity in the mutant peptide correlated with its ability to bind and adopt helical conformations upon interacting with neutral membranes; the wild type peptide RTA3 did not bind to neutral membranes (binding constant reduced by at least 1000-fold). Spectroscopic analysis indicates that disruption of the hydrophobic face of the parent peptide is accommodated in negatively charged membranes without partial peptide unfolding. These observations apply generally to amphipathic helical peptides of this class as we obtained similar results with a peptide and mutant pair (Chen, Y., Mant, C. T., Farmer, S. W., Hancock, R. E., Vasil, M. L., and Hodges, R. S. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 12316-12329) having similar structural properties. In contrast to previous interpretations, we demonstrate that these peptides simply do not bind well to membranes (like those of eukaryotes) with exclusively neutral lipids in their external bilayer leaflet. We highlight a significant role for tryptophan in promoting binding of amphipathic helical peptides to neutral bilayers, augmenting the arsenal of strategies to reduce mammalian toxicity in antimicrobial peptides.},

abstract = {Water-membrane soluble protein and peptide toxins are used in the defense and offense systems of all organisms, including plants and humans. A major group includes antimicrobial peptides, which serve as a nonspecific defense system that complements the highly specific cell-mediated immune response. The increasing resistance of bacteria to conventional antibiotics stimulated the isolation and characterization of many antimicrobial peptides for potential use as new target antibiotics. The finding of thousands of antimicrobial peptides with variable lengths and sequences, all of which are active at similar concentrations, suggests a general mechanism for killing bacteria rather than a specific mechanism that requires preferred active structures. Such a mechanism is in agreement with the "carpet model" that does not require any specific structure or sequence. It seems that when there is an appropriate balance between hydrophobicity and a net positive charge the peptides are active on bacteria. However, selective activity depends also on other parameters, such as the volume of the molecule, its structure, and its oligomeric state in solution and membranes. Further, although many studies support that bacterial membrane damage is a lethal event for bacteria, other studies point to a multihit mechanism in which the peptide binds to several targets in the cytoplasmic region of the bacteria.},

In the current study, we present a collection of methods for an efficient local membrane property calculation, comprising bilayer thickness, area per lipid, deuterium order parameters, Gaussian and mean curvature. The local membrane property calculation allows for a direct mapping of the membrane features, which subsequently can be used for further analysis and visualization of the processes of interest. The main features of the described methods are highlighted in a number of membrane systems, namely: a pure dimyristoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (DMPC) bilayer, a fusion peptide interacting with a membrane, voltage-dependent anion channel protein embedded in a DMPC bilayer, cholesterol enriched bilayer and a coarse grained simulation of a curved palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline lipid membrane. The local membrane property analysis proves to provide an intuitive and detailed view on the observables that are otherwise interpreted as averaged bilayer properties.},

For instance, parameter sets are versioned, linked to the primary citation via PubMed identifier and digital object identifier (DOI), and users can publicly comment on deposited parameters. Licensing and, hence, the conditions for use and dissemination of academically generated data are often unclear. In those cases it is also possible to provide a link instead of uploading a file. A snapshot of the linked file is then archived using the WebCite({\textregistered}) service without further involvement of the user or Lipidbook, thus ensuring a transparent and permanent history of the parameter set. Lipidbook can be accessed freely online at http://lipidbook.bioch.ox.ac.uk. Deposition of data requires online registration.},

abstract = {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources.

RESULTS: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.

AVAILABILITY: GROMACS is an open source and free software available from http://www.gromacs.org.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER predictions. RESULTS: An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff {\textgreater} -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 A for RMSD. CONCLUSION: The I-TASSER server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation of the estimations. The I-TASSER server is freely available to the academic community at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/I-TASSER.},

@article{Shai1999,
abstract = {Permeation of the cell membrane leading to cell death is a mechanism used by a large number of membrane-lytic peptides. Some are linear, mostly helical, and others contain one or more disulfide bonds forming beta-sheet or both beta-sheet and alpha-helix structures. They are all soluble in solution but when they reach the target membrane, conformational changes occur which let them associate with and lyse the membrane. Some lytic peptides are not cell-selective and lyse different microorganisms and normal mammalian cells, while others are specific to either type of cells. Despite extensive studies, the mode of action of membrane-lytic peptides is not fully understood and the basis for their selectivity towards specific target cells is not known. Many studies have shown that peptide-lipid interactions leading to membrane permeation play a major role in their activity. Membrane permeation by amphipathic alpha-helical peptides has been proposed to occur via one of two general mechanisms: (i) transmembrane pore formation via a 'barrel-stave' mechanism; and (ii) membrane destruction/solubilization via a 'carpet' mechanism. This review, which is focused on the different stages of membrane permeation induced by representatives of amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial and cell non-selective lytic peptides distinguishes between the 'carpet' mechanism, which holds for antimicrobial peptides versus the 'barrel-stave' mechanism, which holds for cell non-selective lytic peptides.},

Tp10 is an amphipathic cell-penetrating peptide with a net positive charge of +5 and is known to adopt an $\alpha$-helical secondary structure on the surface of POPC membranes. The study showed that tp10 preferentially binds to the membrane surface with its hydrophobic side facing the hydrophobic lipid core. Such orientation allows Lys residues, with positively charged long side chains, to stay in the polar environment during the insertion process. The simulations revealed that the Lys-phosphate salt bridge is a key factor in determining the orientation of the peptide in the interfacial region as well as in stabilizing the peptide-membrane interaction. The electrostatic attraction between Lys and phosphate groups is also believed to be the main bottleneck for the translocation of tp10 across the membrane.},

Replacement of lysine and arginine by histidine in these peptides completely abrogates their antimicrobial and heparin-binding activities at neutral pH. However, the antibacterial activity against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) as well as the fungus Candida albicans, was restored at acidic conditions (pH 5.5). Fluorescence microscopy and FACS analysis showed that the binding of the histidine-rich peptides to E. coli and Candida was significantly enhanced at pH 5.5. Likewise, fluorescence studies for assessment of membrane permeation as well as electron microscopy analysis of peptide-treated bacteria, paired with studies of peptide effects on liposomes, demonstrated that the peptides induce membrane lysis only at acidic pH. No discernible hemolysis was noted for the histidine-rich peptides. Similar pH-dependent antimicrobial activities were demonstrated for peptides derived from histidine-rich and heparin-binding regions of human kininogen and histidine-rich glycoprotein. The results demonstrate that the presence of an acidic environment is an important regulator of the activity of histidine-rich antimicrobial peptides.},

It is concluded that the agreement between experimental data and simulation is favorable in the hydrophobic region of the membrane, for both the phospholipids and cholesterol.

abstract = {We recently described a family of cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) selected from a combinatorial library that exhibited potent, broad-spectrum activity at neutral pH and low ionic strength. To further delimit the utility and activity profiles of these peptides, we investigated the effects of solution conditions, such as pH and ionic strength, on the efficacy of the peptide antimicrobials against a panel of microorganisms. Peptide minimum sterilizing concentrations (MSCs) varied linearly with pH for each subtype within our family of CAMPs for all organisms tested. The peptides were much less effective against Gram-negative bacteria at high pH, consistent with a decrease in net positive charge on the peptides. A similar trend was observed for the fungus Candida albicans. Surprisingly, the opposite pH trend was observed with the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, an additive ionic strength effect was observed with increasing buffer strengths at identical pH values. The extreme difference in the observed pH behavior between Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms is attributed to the presence of native charged molecules in the much thicker peptidoglycan layer of the Gram-positive organism. The novel species-specific effects of pH observed here have important implications for applications using CAMPs and for the design of novel CAMPs.},

abstract = {A novel 11 kDa antimicrobial protein, named as hebraein, and having a unique amino acid sequence, was purified from the hemolymph of fed female Amblyomma hebraeum ticks. A full-length cDNA clone encoding hebraein was isolated from a cDNA library made from tick synganglia. Hebraein consists of 102 amino acids, including 6 cysteine residues; has 9 histidines in its C-terminal domain that are mainly present as HX repeats; and has no significant similarity to any known protein. The secondary structure prediction is very clearly all alpha-helical (4-6 helices) except for a very short extension at the C terminus. Such high alpha-helical content is quite different from known antimicrobial proteins. Recombinant hebraein and a mutant lacking the histidine residues in the C-terminal domain were constructed and expressed. Assayed at the slightly acidic pH equivalent of fed female tick hemolymph, the wild-type and the histidine-rich recombinant hebraein had stronger antimicrobial activities than the histidine-deficient mutant. The pH-dependent properties of histidine-rich antimicrobial proteins may allow the design of agents that would function selectively in specific pH environments. The results from protein profiling of hemolymph, analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry combined with ProteinChip technology and RT-PCR analysis suggested that this antimicrobial protein was up-regulated by blood feeding. Our findings describe a new type of antimicrobial protein with multiple cysteine and histidine residues, and with unique secondary structure.},

abstract = {The human hepcidin 25 (hep-25) and its isoform hepcidin 20 (hep-20) are histidine-containing, cystein rich, $\beta$-sheet structured peptides endowed with antimicrobial activity. We previously reported that, similar to other histidine-containing peptides, the microbicidal effects of hep-25 and hep-20 are highly enhanced at acidic pH. In the present study, we investigated whether pH influences the mode of action of hep-25 and hep-20 on Escherichia coli American Type Culture Collection 25922 and model membranes. A striking release of $\beta$-galactosidase by hepcidin-treated E. coli was observed at pH 5.0, whereas no inner membrane permeabilization capacity was seen at pH 7.4, even at bactericidal concentrations. Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry when assessing the internalization of propidium iodide by hepcidin-treated E. coli. Scanning electron microscope imaging revealed that both peptides induced the formation of numerous blebs on the surface of bacterial cells at acidic pH but not at neutral pH. Moreover, a phospholipid/polydiacetylene colourimetric vesicle assay revealed a more evident membrane damaging effect at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.4. The leakage of entrapped dextrans of increasing molecular size from liposomes was also assessed at pH 7.4. Consistent with the lack of $\beta$-galactosidase release from whole E. coli observed at such a pH value, evident leakage of only the smallest 4-kDa dextran (and not of dextrans of 20 or 70 kDa) was observed, indicating a poor ability of hepcidin peptides to permeabilize liposome vesicles at pH 7.4. Altogether, the data obtained in the present study using different approaches strongly suggest that the ability of hepcidins to perturb bacterial membranes is markedly pH-dependent.},

abstract = {The rapid rise of antibiotic resistance in pathogens becomes a serious and growing threat to medicine and public health. Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an important line of defense in the immune system against invading bacteria and microbial infection. In this work, we present a combined computational and experimental study of the biological activity and membrane interaction of the computationally designed Bac2A-based peptide library. We used the MARTINI coarse-grained molecular dynamics with adaptive biasing force method and the umbrella sampling technique to investigate the translocation of a total of 91 peptides with different amino acid substitutions through a mixed anionic POPE/POPG (3:1) bilayer and a neutral POPC bilayer, which mimic the bacterial inner membrane and the human red blood cell (hRBC) membrane, respectively. Potential of mean force (PMF, free energy profile) was obtained to measure the free energy barrier required to transfer the peptides from the bulk water phase to the water-membrane interface and to the bilayer interior. Different PMF profiles can indeed identify different membrane insertion scenarios by mapping out peptide-lipid energy landscapes, which are correlated with antimicrobial activity and hemolytic activity. Computationally designed peptides were further tested experimentally for their antimicrobial and hemolytic activities using bacteria growth inhibition assay and hemolysis assay. Comparison of PMF data with cell assay results reveals a good correlation of the peptides between predictive transmembrane activity and antimicrobial/hemolytic activity. Moreover, the most active mutants with the balanced substitutions of positively charged Arg and hydrophobic Trp residues at specific positions were discovered to achieve the improved antimicrobial activity while minimizing red blood cell lysis. Such substitutions provide more effective and cooperative interactions to distinguish the peptide interaction with different lipid bilayers. This work provides a useful computational tool to better understand the mechanism and energetics of membrane insertion of AMPs and to rationally design more effective AMPs.},

abstract = {Recent experiments in function mechanism study reported that a pH low-insertion peptide (pHLIP) can insert into a zwitterionic palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid bilayer at acidic pH while binding to the bilayer surface at basic pH. However, the atomic details of the pH-dependent interaction of pHLIP with a POPC bilayer are not well understood. In this study, we investigate the detailed interactions of pHLIP with a POPC bilayer at acidic and basic pH conditions as those used in function mechanism study, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Simulations have been performed by employing the initial configurations, where pHLIP is placed in aqueous solution, parallel to bilayer surface (system S), partially-inserted (system P), or fully-inserted (system F) in POPC bilayers. On the basis of multiple 200-ns MD simulations, we found (1) pHLIP in system S can spontaneously insert into a POPC bilayer at acidic pH, while binding to the membrane surface at basic pH; (2) pHLIP in system P can insert deep into a POPC bilayer at acidic pH, while it has a tendency to exit, and stays at bilayer surface at basic pH; (3) pHLIP in system F keeps in an $\alpha$-helical structure at acidic pH while partially unfolding at basic pH. This study provides at atomic-level the pH-induced insertion of pHLIP into POPC bilayer.},

@article{DeVillemereuil2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uncertainty in comparative analyses can come from at least two sources: a) phylogenetic uncertainty in the tree topology or branch lengths, and b) uncertainty due to intraspecific variation in trait values, either due to measurement error or natural individual variation. Most phylogenetic comparative methods do not account for such uncertainties. Not accounting for these sources of uncertainty leads to false perceptions of precision (confidence intervals will be too narrow) and inflated significance in hypothesis testing (e.g. p-values will be too small). Although there is some application-specific software for fitting Bayesian models accounting for phylogenetic error, more general and flexible software is desirable.

METHODS: We developed models to directly incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty into a range of analyses that biologists commonly perform, using a Bayesian framework and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses.

RESULTS: We demonstrate applications in linear regression, quantification of phylogenetic signal, and measurement error models. Phylogenetic uncertainty was incorporated by applying a prior distribution for the phylogeny, where this distribution consisted of the posterior tree sets from Bayesian phylogenetic tree estimation programs. The models were analysed using simulated data sets, and applied to a real data set on plant traits, from rainforest plant species in Northern Australia. Analyses were performed using the free and open source software OpenBUGS and JAGS.

CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty through an empirical prior distribution of trees leads to more precise estimation of regression model parameters than using a single consensus tree and enables a more realistic estimation of confidence intervals. In addition, models incorporating measurement errors and/or individual variation, in one or both variables, are easily formulated in the Bayesian framework. We show that BUGS is a useful, flexible general purpose tool for phylogenetic comparative analyses, particularly for modelling in the face of phylogenetic uncertainty and accounting for measurement error or individual variation in explanatory variables. Code for all models is provided in the BUGS model description language.},

abstract = {The metabolic stability is a very important idiosyncracy of proteins that is related to their global flexibility, intramolecular fluctuations, various internal dynamic processes, as well as many marvelous biological functions. Determination of protein's metabolic stability would provide us with useful information for in-depth understanding of the dynamic action mechanisms of proteins. Although several experimental methods have been developed to measure protein's metabolic stability, they are time-consuming and more expensive. Reported in this paper is a computational method, which is featured by (1) integrating various properties of proteins, such as biochemical and physicochemical properties, subcellular locations, network properties and protein complex property, (2) using the mRMR (Maximum Relevance {\&} Minimum Redundancy) principle and the IFS (Incremental Feature Selection) procedure to optimize the prediction engine, and (3) being able to identify proteins among the four types: "short", "medium", "long", and "extra-long" half-life spans. It was revealed through our analysis that the following seven characters played major roles in determining the stability of proteins: (1) KEGG enrichment scores of the protein and its neighbors in network, (2) subcellular locations, (3) polarity, (4) amino acids composition, (5) hydrophobicity, (6) secondary structure propensity, and (7) the number of protein complexes the protein involved. It was observed that there was an intriguing correlation between the predicted metabolic stability of some proteins and the real half-life of the drugs designed to target them. These findings might provide useful insights for designing protein-stability-relevant drugs. The computational method can also be used as a large-scale tool for annotating the metabolic stability for the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age.},

abstract = {Thermostability of proteins arises from the simultaneous effect of several forces, which in fact lead to decreased flexibility of the polypeptide chain. This is verified by flexibility indices, which are derived from normalized B-values of individual amino acids in several refined three-dimensional structures. Flexibility indices show that overall flexibility is reduced when thermostability is increased. Protein molecules require both flexibility and rigidity to function, but the higher the temperature optimum and stability the more rigid is the structure needed to compensate for increased thermal fluctuations. Flexibilities of proteins performing the same catalytic activity seem to be about the same at their temperature optima, but the more rigid thermostable proteins reach the flexibility of thermolabile proteins at higher temperatures. In several proteins such as allosteric enzymes, some local sites of flexibility are highly conserved. The relevance of reduced flexibility to overall stability of proteins is also discussed. Flexibility indices and profiles can be used in the design of more stable proteins by site-directed mutagenesis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Though antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) show great potential as novel antibiotics, therapeutic applications are hindered by their low stability, toxicity and high manufacturing cost. Various chemical modification strategies are employed to overcome these problems. However, chemical modifications often significantly increase the manufacturing cost of AMPs with only limited pharmacokinetic advantages. Therefore, we developed AMPs with enhanced stability and cell specificity that can be economically produced. METHODS: Peptides were designed by systematic amino acid arrangement without the incorporation of both non-natural amino acids and peptidomimetics. Antimicrobial activities were measured against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi by MIC evaluation under both standard and physiologically relevant conditions. Cytotoxicity towards human cells was evaluated to verify selective antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial mechanism of the peptides was elucidated by $\beta$-galactosidase assay and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Among the designed peptides, GNU6 and GNU7 showed potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi and maintained their activity in the presence of 150 mM NaCl and 10{\%} serum. These peptides were not digested by exposure to trypsin, chymotrypsin and aureolysin for up to 12 h and showed potent antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Moreover, they did not affect the viability of erythrocytes, keratinocytes and fibroblasts up to 128 mg/L. A membrane permeabilization assay and scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that GNU6 and GNU7 compromised membrane integrity and function in microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that GNU6 and GNU7 might overcome serious problems that currently prevent the clinical use of AMPs and be developed as novel antimicrobial agents.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Increasing use of structural modeling for understanding structure-function relationships in proteins has led to the need to ensure that the protein models being used are of acceptable quality. Quality of a given protein structure can be assessed by comparing various intrinsic structural properties of the protein to those observed in high-resolution protein structures.

RESULTS: In this study, we present tools to compare a given structure to high-resolution crystal structures. We assess packing by calculating the total void volume, the percentage of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds, the number of steric clashes and the scaling of the accessible surface area. We assess covalent geometry by determining bond lengths, angles, dihedrals and rotamers. The statistical parameters for the above measures, obtained from high-resolution crystal structures enable us to provide a quality-score that points to specific areas where a given protein structural model needs improvement.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We provide these tools that appraise protein structures in the form of a web server Gaia (http://chiron.dokhlab.org). Gaia evaluates the packing and covalent geometry of a given protein structure and provides quantitative comparison of the given structure to high-resolution crystal structures.

abstract = {The skin secretions of amphibians are rich in host defence peptides. The membrane interactions of the antimicrobial peptides, aurein 1.2, citropin 1.1 and maculatin 1.1, isolated from Australian tree frogs, are reviewed. Although all three peptides are amphipathic alpha-helices, the mode of action of these membrane-active peptides is not defined. The peptides have a net positive charge and range in length from 13 to 21 residues, with the longest, maculatin 1.1, having a proline at position 15. Interestingly, alanine substitution at Pro-15 leads to loss of activity. The effects of these peptides on phospholipid bilayers indicate different mechanisms for pore formation and lysis of model membranes, with the shorter peptides exhibiting a carpet-like mechanism and the longest peptide forming pores in phospholipid bilayer membranes.},

abstract = {Understanding the penetration mechanisms of carbon nanotube (CNTs)-encapsulated drugs through the phospholipid bilayer cell membrane is an important issue for the development of intracellular drug delivery systems. In the present work, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation was used to explore the possibility of penetration of a polar drug, paclitaxel (PTX), encapsulated inside the CNT, through a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer membrane. The interactions between PTX and CNT and between PTX and the confined water molecules inside the CNT had a significant effect on the penetration process of PTX. The results reveal that the presence of a PTX molecule increases the magnitude of the pulling force. The effect of pulling velocity on the penetration mechanism was also investigated by a series of SMD simulations, and it is shown that the pulling velocity had a significant effect on pulling force and the interaction between lipid bilayer and drug molecule.},

Here we summarize current knowledge for both synthetic vesicle experiments and microbe experiments, with a focus on comparisons between the two. Microbial experiments are done at peptide to lipid ratios that are at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than vesicle-based experiments. To close the gap between the two concentration regimes, we propose an "interfacial activity model", which is based on an experimentally testable molecular image of AMP-membrane interactions. The interfacial activity model may be useful in driving engineering and design of novel AMPs.},

@article{Prenner1999,
abstract = {Gramicidin S (GS) is a cyclic decapeptide of primary structure [cyclo-(Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro)(2)] secreted by Bacillus brevis. It is a powerful antimicrobial agent with potent cidal action on a wide variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as on several pathogenic fungi. Unfortunately, however, GS is rather non-specific in its actions and also exhibits a high hemolytic activity, limiting its use as an antibiotic to topical applications. In a wide variety of environments, the GS molecule exists as a very stable amphiphilic antiparallel beta-sheet structure with a polar and a non-polar surface. Moreover, the large number of structure-activity studies of GS analogs which have been carried out indicate that this 'sidedness' structure is required for its antimicrobial action. In this review, we summarize both published and unpublished biophysical studies of the interactions of GS with lipid bilayer model and with biological membranes. In general, these studies show that GS partitions strongly into liquid-crystalline lipid bilayers in both model and biological membranes, and seems to be located primarily in the glycerol backbone region below the polar headgroups and above the hydrocarbon chains. The presence of GS appears to perturb lipid packing in liquid-crystalline bilayers and GS can induce the formation of inverted cubic phases at lower temperatures in lipids capable of forming such phases at higher temperature in the absence of peptide. The presence of GS at lower concentrations also increases the permeability of model and biological membranes and at higher concentrations causes membrane destabilization. There is good evidence from studies of the interaction of GS with bacterial cells that the destruction of the integrity of the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane is the primary mode of the antimicrobial action of this peptide. The considerable lipid specificity of GS for binding to and destabilization of lipid bilayer model membranes indicates that the design of GS analogs with an improved antimicrobial potency and a markedly decreased toxicity for eukaryotic cell plasma membranes should be possible.},

Based on the impact of these dipeptides on the unstable proteins over the stable ones, a weight value of instability is assigned to each of the dipeptides. For a given protein the summation of these weight values normalized to the length of its sequence helps to distinguish between unstable and stable proteins. Results suggest that the in vivo instability of proteins is possibly determined by the order of certain amino acids in its sequence. An attempt is made to correlate metabolic stability of proteins with features of their primary sequence where weight values of instability for a protein of known sequence could thus be used as an index for predicting its stability characteristics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Though antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) show great potential as novel antibiotics, therapeutic applications are hindered by their low stability, toxicity and high manufacturing cost. Various chemical modification strategies are employed to overcome these problems. However, chemical modifications often significantly increase the manufacturing cost of AMPs with only limited pharmacokinetic advantages. Therefore, we developed AMPs with enhanced stability and cell specificity that can be economically produced.

METHODS: Peptides were designed by systematic amino acid arrangement without the incorporation of both non-natural amino acids and peptidomimetics. Antimicrobial activities were measured against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi by MIC evaluation under both standard and physiologically relevant conditions. Cytotoxicity towards human cells was evaluated to verify selective antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial mechanism of the peptides was elucidated by $\beta$-galactosidase assay and scanning electron microscopy.

RESULTS: Among the designed peptides, GNU6 and GNU7 showed potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi and maintained their activity in the presence of 150 mM NaCl and 10{\%} serum. These peptides were not digested by exposure to trypsin, chymotrypsin and aureolysin for up to 12 h and showed potent antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Moreover, they did not affect the viability of erythrocytes, keratinocytes and fibroblasts up to 128 mg/L. A membrane permeabilization assay and scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that GNU6 and GNU7 compromised membrane integrity and function in microorganisms.

CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that GNU6 and GNU7 might overcome serious problems that currently prevent the clinical use of AMPs and be developed as novel antimicrobial agents.},

The secondary structure is shown to be helical in all of the solvent systems. The NMR data were used as a set of restraints for a simulated annealing protocol that generated a family of three-dimensional structures of the peptide in DPC micelles, which superimposed best between residues 4 and 20. For these residues, the mean pairwise rms difference for the backbone atoms is 0.47 +/- 0.10 A from the average structure. The calculated peptide structures appear to be curved, with the bend centered at residues Phe12 and Gly13.},

@article{Lee2013,
abstract = {The potency and selectivity of many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are correlated with their ability to interact with and disrupt the bacterial cell membrane. In vitro experiments using model membranes have been used to determine the mechanism of membrane disruption of AMPs. Because the mechanism of action of an AMP depends on the ability of the model membrane to accurately mimic the cell membrane, it is important to understand the effect of membrane composition. Anionic lipids that are present in the outer membrane of prokaryotes but are less common in eukaryotic membranes are usually thought to be key for the bacterial selectivity of AMPs. We show by fluorescence measurements of peptide-induced membrane permeabilization that the presence of anionic lipids at high concentrations can actually inhibit membrane disruption by the AMP MSI-78 (pexiganan), a representative of a large class of highly cationic AMPs. Paramagnetic quenching studies suggest MSI-78 is in a surface-associated inactive mode in anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles but is in a deeply buried and presumably more active mode in zwitterionic dodecylphosphocholine micelles. Furthermore, a switch in mechanism occurs with lipid composition. Membrane fragmentation with MSI-78 can be observed in mixed vesicles containing both anionic and zwitterionic lipids but not in vesicles composed of a single lipid of either type. These findings suggest membrane affinity and membrane permeabilization are not always correlated, and additional effects that may be more reflective of the actual cellular environment can be seen as the complexity of the model membranes is increased.},

@article{Yun2011,
abstract = {The brevity of molecular dynamics simulations often limits their utility in developing and evaluating structural models of proteins. The duration of simulations can be increased greatly using discrete molecular dynamics (DMD). However, the trade off is that coarse graining, implicit solvent, and other time-saving procedures reduce the accuracy of DMD simulations. Here we address some of these issues by comparing results of DMD and conventional all atom MD simulations on proteins of known structure and misfolded proteins. DMD simulations were performed at a range of temperatures to identify a 'physiological' temperature for DMD that mimicked molecular motions of conventional MD simulations at 310K. We also compared results obtained with a new implicit solvent model developed here based on Miyazawa-Jernigan interaction pair potential to those obtained with a previously used model based on Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy scale. We compared DMD and all atom molecular dynamics with explicit water by simulating both correctly and incorrectly folded structures, and monomeric and dimeric $\alpha$ $\beta$-barrel structures to analyze the ability of these procedures to distinguish between good and bad models. Deviations from the correct structures were substantially greater with DMD, as would be expected from coarse-graining and longer simulation time. Deviations were smallest for $\beta$-strands and greatest for coiled loops. Structures of the incorrectly folded models were very poorly preserved during the DMD simulations; but both methods were able to distinguish between the correct and the incorrect structures based on differences in the magnitudes of the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) from the starting conformation.},

abstract = {Class IIa bacteriocins are potent antimicrobial peptides produced by lactic acid bacteria to destroy competing microorganisms. The N-terminal domain of these peptides consists of a conserved YGNGV sequence and a disulphide bond. The YGNGV motif is essential for activity, whereas, the two cysteines involved in the disulphide bond can be replaced with hydrophobic residues. The C-terminal region has variable sequences, and folds into a conserved amphipathic $\alpha$-helical structure. To elucidate the structure-activity relationship in the N-terminal domain of these peptides, three analogues (1-3) of a class IIa bacteriocin, Leucocin A (LeuA), were designed and synthesized by replacing the N-terminal $\beta$-sheet residues of the native peptide with shorter $\beta$-turn motifs. Such replacement abolished the antibacterial activity in the analogues, however, analogue 1 was able to competitively inhibit the activity of native LeuA. Native LeuA (37-mer) was synthesized using native chemical ligation method in high yield. Solution conformation study using circular dichroism spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the C-terminal region of analogue 1 adopts helical folding as found in LeuA, while the N-terminal region did not fold into $\beta$-sheet conformation. These structure-activity studies highlight the role of proper folding and complete sequence in the activity of class IIa bacteriocins.},

Collection of Anti-Microbial Peptides (CAMP) is a free online database that has been developed for advancement of the present understanding on antimicrobial peptides. It is manually curated and currently holds 3782 antimicrobial sequences. These sequences are divided into experimentally validated (patents and non-patents: 2766) and predicted (1016) datasets based on their reference literature. Information like source organism, activity (MIC values), reference literature, target and non-target organisms of AMPs are captured in the database. The experimentally validated dataset has been further used to develop prediction tools for AMPs based on the machine learning algorithms like Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Discriminant Analysis (DA). The prediction models gave accuracies of 93.2{\%} (RF), 91.5{\%} (SVM) and 87.5{\%} (DA) on the test datasets. The prediction and sequence analysis tools, including BLAST, are integrated in the database. CAMP will be a useful database for study of sequence-activity and -specificity relationships in AMPs.

abstract = {Protein structures are routinely compared by their root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) in atomic coordinates after optimal rigid body superposition. What is not so clear is the significance of different RMSD values, particularly above the customary arbitrary cutoff for obvious similarity of 2-3 A. Our earlier work argued for an intrinsic cutoff for protein similarity that varied with the number of residues in the polypeptide chains being compared. Here we introduce a new measure, rho, of structural similarity based on RMSD that is independent of the sizes of the molecules involved, or of any other special properties of molecules. When rho is less than 0.4-0.5, protein structures are visually recognized to be obviously similar, but the mathematically pleasing intrinsic cutoff of rho {\textless} 1.0 corresponds to overall similarity in folding motif at a level not usually recognized until smoothing of the polypeptide chain path makes it striking. When the structures are scaled to unit radius of gyration and equal principle moments of inertia, the comparisons are even more universal, since they are no longer obscured by differences in overall size and ellipticity. With increasing chain length, the distribution of rho for pairs of random structures is skewed to higher values, but the value for the best 1{\%} of the comparisons rises only slowly with the number of residues. This level is close to an intrinsic cutoff between similar and dissimilar comparisons, namely the maximal scaled rho possible for the two structures to be more similar to each other than one is to the other's mirror image. The intrinsic cutoff is independent of the number of residues or points being compared. For proteins having fewer than 100 residues, the 1{\%} rho falls below the intrinsic cutoff, so that for very small proteins, geometrically significant similarity can often occur by chance. We believe these ideas will be helpful in judging success in NMR structure determination and protein folding modeling.},

The most common structures are represented by peptides assuming a alpha-helical conformation in organic solutions or disulfide-stabilized beta-sheets with or without alpha-helical domains present. The diverse activity spectrum of these peptides may indicate different modes of action.

No differences were found within either sixth- or seventh-pandemic isolates; however, variation was found between the two forms and among the non-O1 isolates. O139 isolates had sequences identical to those of seventh-pandemic isolates. Phylogenetic trees with Vibrio mimicus as the outgroup suggest that the sixth-pandemic, seventh-pandemic, and U.S. Gulf isolates are three clones that have evolved independently from different lineages of environmental, nontoxigenic, non-O1 V. cholerae isolates. There is evidence for horizontal transfer of O antigen, since isolates with nearly identical asd sequences had different O antigens, and isolates with the O1 antigen did not cluster together but were found in different lineages. We also found evidence for recombination events within the asd gene of V. cholerae. V. cholerae may have a higher level of genetic exchange and a lower level of clonality than species such as Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli.},

By contrast, bacterial and eukaryal membrane phospholipids are fatty acid esters linked to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). The two key dehydrogenase enzymes that produce G1P and G3P, G1PDH and G3PDH, respectively, are not homologous. Various models propose that these enzymes originated during the speciation of the two prokaryotic domains, and the nature (and even the very existence) of lipid membranes in the last universal common ancestor (cenancestor) is subject to debate. G1PDH and G3PDH belong to two separate superfamilies that are universally distributed, suggesting that members of both superfamilies existed in the cenancestor. Furthermore, archaea possess homologues to known bacterial genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and synthesize fatty acid phospholipids. The cenancestor seems likely to have been endowed with membrane lipids whose synthesis was enzymatic but probably non-stereospecific.},

abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful research tool to investigate structural and dynamical properties of biological membranes and membrane proteins. The lipid structures of simple membrane systems in recent MD simulations are in good agreement with those obtained by experiments. However, for protein-membrane systems, the complexity of protein-lipid interactions makes investigation of lipid structure difficult. Although the area per lipid is one of the essential structural properties in membrane systems, the area in protein-membrane systems cannot be computed easily by conventional approaches like the Voronoi tessellation method. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method combining the two-dimensional Voronoi tessellation and Monte Carlo integration methods. This approach computes individual surface areas of lipid molecules not only in bulk lipids but also in proximity to membrane proteins. We apply the method to all-atom MD trajectories of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-pump and the SecY protein-conducting channel. The calculated lipid surface area is in agreement with experimental values and consistent with other structural parameters of lipid bilayers. We also observe changes in the average area per lipid induced by the conformational transition of the SecY channel. Our method is particularly useful for examining equilibration of lipids around membrane proteins and for analyzing the time course of protein-lipid interactions.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) are the main lipid components of the inner bacterial membrane. A computer model for such a membrane was built of palmitoyloleoyl PE (POPE) and palmitoyloleoyl PG (POPG) in the proportion 3:1, and sodium ions (Na+) to neutralize the net negative charge on each POPG (POPE-POPG bilayer). The bilayer was simulated for 25 ns. A final 10-ns trajectory fragment was used for analyses. In the bilayer interfacial region, POPEs and POPGs interact readily with one another via intermolecular hydrogen (H) bonds and water bridges. POPE is the main H-bond donor in either PEPE or PEPG H-bonds; PGPG H-bonds are rarely formed. Almost all POPEs are H-bonded and/or water bridged to either POPE or POPG but PE-PG links are favored. In effect, the atom packing in the near-the-interface regions of the bilayer core is tight. Na+ does not bind readily to lipids, and interlipid links via Na+ are not numerous. Although POPG and POPE comprise one bilayer, their bilayer properties differ. The average surface area per POPG is larger and the average vertical location of the POPG phosphate group is lower than those of POPE. Also, the alkyl chains of POPG are more ordered and less densely packed than the POPE chains. The main conclusion of this study is that in the PE-PG bilayer PE interacts more strongly with PG than with PE. This is a likely molecular-level event behind a regulating mechanism developed by the bacteria to control its membrane permeability and stability consisting in changes of the relative PG/PE concentration in the membrane.},

In this review we provide an overview of the 'sequence template' approach which we have used to design potent artificial helical AMPs, to guide structure-activity relationship studies aimed at their optimization, and to help identify novel natural AMP sequences. Combining this approach with the rational use of natural and non-proteinogenic amino acid building blocks has allowed us to probe the individual effects on the peptides' activity of structural and physico-chemical parameters such as the size, propensity for helical structuring, amphipathic hydrophobicity, cationicity, and hydrophobic or polar sector characteristics.

Chem. 2005, 280:12316-12329, 2005) was used as the framework to study the effects of peptide hydrophobicity on the mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptides. Hydrophobicity was systematically decreased or increased by replacing leucine residues with less hydrophobic alanine residues or replacing alanine residues with more hydrophobic leucine residues on the nonpolar face of the helix, respectively. Hydrophobicity of the nonpolar face of the amphipathic helix was demonstrated to correlate with peptide helicity (measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy) and self-associating ability (measured by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography temperature profiling) in aqueous environments. Higher hydrophobicity was correlated with stronger hemolytic activity. In contrast, there was an optimum hydrophobicity window in which high antimicrobial activity could be obtained. Decreased or increased hydrophobicity beyond this window dramatically decreased antimicrobial activity. The decreased antimicrobial activity at high peptide hydrophobicity can be explained by the strong peptide self-association which prevents the peptide from passing through the cell wall in prokaryotic cells, whereas increased peptide self-association had no effect on peptide access to eukaryotic membranes.},

A plausible mode of action explaining the peptides' behaviour in model membranes, bacteria and host cells is proposed. Cytotoxic activity, in general, correlated strongly with the hydrophobic sector depth, and required a majority of aliphatic residue side chains having more than two carbon atoms. It also correlated significantly with the size of polar sector residues, which determines the penetration depth of the peptide via the so-called snorkel effect. Both an oblique gradient of long to short aliphatic residues along the hydrophobic face and a stabilized helical structure increased activity against host cells but not against bacteria, as revealed by haemolysis, flow cytofluorimetric studies on lymphocytes and surface plasmon resonance studies with model phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol membranes. The mode of interaction changes radically for a peptide with a stable, preformed helical conformation compared with others that form a structure only on membrane binding. The close correlation between effects observed in biological and model systems suggests that the 'carpet model' correctly represents the type of peptides that are bacteria-selective, whereas the behaviour of those that lyse host cells is more complex.},

abstract = {We describe here a systematic study to determine the effect on secondary structure of d-amino acid substitutions in the nonpolar face of an amphipathic alpha-helical peptide. The helix-destabilizing ability of 19 d-amino acid residues in an amphipathic alpha-helical model peptide was evaluated by reversed-phase HPLC and CD spectroscopy. l-Amino acid and d-amino acid residues show a wide range of helix-destabilizing effects relative to Gly, as evidenced in melting temperatures (DeltaTm) ranging from -8.5 degrees C to 30.5 degrees C for the l-amino acids and -9.5 degrees C to 9.0 degrees C for the d-amino acids. Helix stereochemistry stability coefficients defined as the difference in Tm values for the l- and d-amino acid substitutions [(DeltaTm' = TmL and TmD)] ranging from 1 degrees C to 34.5 degrees C. HPLC retention times [DeltatR(XL-XD)] also had values ranging from -0.52 to 7.31 min at pH 7.0. The helix-destabilizing ability of a specific d-amino acid is highly dependent on its side-chain, with no clear relationship to the helical propensity of its corresponding l-enantiomers. In both CD and reversed-phase HPLC studies, d-amino acids with beta-branched side-chains destabilize alpha-helical structure to the greatest extent. A series of helix stability coefficients was subsequently determined, which should prove valuable both for protein structure-activity studies and de novo design of novel biologically active peptides.},

abstract = {Drosocin is a cationic 19 amino acid peptide secreted by Drosophila in response to septic injury. The sequence (GKPRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV) contains six Pro and four Arg residues which are incorporated into three repeated triplet sequences Pro-Arg-Pro. The peptide is glycosylated at Thr11 and has potent antimicrobial activity. This activity is markedly reduced on deglycosylation, but a structural basis for this has not been previously established. In the current study, the solution conformations of drosocin and its non-glycosylated derivative were determined by NMR spectroscopy and structure calculations. The NMR and structure studies showed that the peptides have significant populations of essentially random coil conformations in aqueous solution. Addition of 50{\%} trifluoroethanol causes the development of small populations of folded conformations, mainly in the form of turns. In particular, turn elements occur near residues 4-7, 10-13, 17, and 18. No substantial difference was detected in the predominantly random coil conformation of the glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms, but there are subtle differences in the small populations of folded conformers. In particular, the turn at residues 10-13 tends toward a more extended structure on glycosylation, while there is some tightening of the downstream turn at residues 17 and 18. There are a significant number of nuclear Overhauser enhancement contacts between the sugar moiety and the peptide near the glycosylation site, consistent with a close association between them. Despite this close association, the pKa of H13, which is proximate to the glycosylation site, was found to be unaffected by glycosylation.},

From (15)N relaxation studies, the helix is a rigid structure in the membrane-mimicking environment. Strong NOESY cross-peaks from the pleurocidin to the aliphatic chain on DPC confirm that pleurocidin is contained within the DPC micelle and not associated with the surface of the micelle. From diffusion studies it was determined that each micelle contains at least two pleurocidin molecules.},

Ranatuerin-2CSa (GILSSFKGVAKGVAKDLAG KLLETLKCKITGC), first isolated from skin secretions of the Cascades frog, Rana cascadae, represents a promising candidate for drug development. The peptide shows potent growth inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli (MIC=5 microM) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=10 microM) but displays haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LC(50)=160 microM). The solution structure of ranatuerin-2CSa was investigated by proton NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling. In aqueous solution, the peptide lacks secondary structure but, in a 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE-d(3))-H(2)O solvent mixture, the structure is characterised by a full length helix-turn-helix conformation between residues I(2)-L(21), L(22)-L(25) and K(26)-T(30) respectively. This structural information will facilitate the design of novel therapeutic agents based upon the ranatuerin-2CSa structure with improved antimicrobial potencies but decreased cytolytic activities against mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Topologically, platelet factor-4 kinocidins consist of distinct N-terminal extended, C-terminal helical, and interposing gamma-core structural domains. The C-terminal alpha-helices autonomously confer direct microbicidal activity, and the synthetic antimicrobial peptide RP-1 is modeled upon these domains. In this study, the structure of RP-1 was assessed using several complementary techniques. The high-resolution structure of RP-1 was determined by NMR in anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and zwitterionic dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles, which approximate prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes, respectively. NMR data indicate the peptide assumes an amphipathic alpha-helical backbone conformation in both micelle environments. However, small differences were observed in the side-chain orientations of lysine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine residues in SDS versus DPC environments. NMR experiments with a paramagnetic probe indicated differences in positioning of the peptide within the two micelle types. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the peptide in both micelle types were also performed to add insight into the peptide/micelle interactions and to assess the validity of this technique to predict the structure of peptides in complex with micelles. MD independently predicted RP-1 to interact only peripherally with the DPC micelle, leaving its spherical shape intact. In contrast, RP-1 entered deeply into and significantly distorted the SDS micelle. Overall, the experimental and MD results support a preferential specificity of RP-1 for anionic membranes over zwitterionic membranes. This specificity likely derives from differences in RP-1 interaction with distinct lipid systems, including subtle differences in side chain orientations, rather than gross changes in RP-1 structure in the two lipid environments.},

PlnJ, a 25 residue peptide, has an N-terminal amphiphilic alpha-helix between Trp-3 and Tyr-15. The 32 residues long PlnK forms a central amphiphilic alpha-helix between Gly-9 and Leu-24. Measurements of the effect on anti-microbial activity of single glycine replacements in PlnJ and PlnK show that Gly-13 and Gly-17 in both peptides are very sensitive, giving more than a 100-fold reduction in activity when large residues replace glycine. In variants where other glycine residues, Gly-20 in PlnJ and Gly-7, Gly-9, Gly-24 and Gly-25 in PlnK, were replaced, the activity was reduced less than 10-fold. It is proposed that the detrimental effect on activity when exchanging Gly-13 and Gly-17 in PlnJ and PlnK is a result of reduced ability of the two peptides to interact through the GxxxG-motifs constituting Gly-13 and Gly-17.},

It is considered to be a potentially useful tool for the genetic engineering of disease resistance in transgenic crop plants and for the design of new fungicides. The three-dimensional structure of MiAMP1 was determined through homonuclear and heteronuclear ((15)N) 2D NMR spectroscopy and subsequent simulated annealing calculations with the ultimate aim of understanding the structure-activity relationships of the protein. MiAMP1 is made up of eight beta-strands which are arranged in two Greek key motifs. These Greek key motifs associate to form a Greek key beta-barrel. This structure is unique amongst plant antimicrobial proteins and forms a new class which we term the beta-barrelins. Interestingly, the structure of MiAMP1 bears remarkable similarity to a yeast killer toxin from Williopsis mrakii. This toxin acts by inhibiting beta-glucan synthesis and thereby cell wall construction in sensitive strains of yeast. The structural similarity of MiAMP1 and WmKT, which originate from plant and fungal phyla respectively, may reflect a similar mode of action.},

As such, it plays an important role in hereditary hemochromatosis, a serious iron overload disease. In this study, we report the solution structures of the hepcidin-20 and -25 amino acid peptides determined by standard two-dimensional (1)H NMR spectroscopy. These small cysteine-rich peptides form a distorted beta-sheet with an unusual vicinal disulfide bridge found at the turn of the hairpin, which is probably of functional significance. Both peptides exhibit an overall amphipathic structure with six of the eight Cys involved in maintaining interstrand connectivity. Hepcidin-25 assumes major and minor conformations centered about the Pro residue near the N-terminal end. Further NMR diffusion studies indicate that hepcidin-20 exists as a monomer in solution, whereas hepcidin-25 readily aggregates, a property that may contribute to the different activities of the two peptides. The nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy spectra of the hepcidin-25 aggregates indicate an interface for peptide interactions that again involves the first five residues from the N-terminal end.},

abstract = {Microplusin, a Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus antimicrobial peptide (AMP) is the first fully characterized member of a new family of cysteine-rich AMPs with histidine-rich regions at the N and C termini. In the tick, microplusin belongs to the arsenal of innate defense molecules active against bacteria and fungi. Here we describe the NMR solution structure of microplusin and demonstrate that the protein binds copper II and iron II. Structured as a single alpha-helical globular domain, microplusin consists of five alpha-helices: alpha1 (residues Gly-9 to Arg-21), alpha2 (residues Glu-27 to Asn-40), alpha3 (residues Arg-44 to Thr-54), alpha4 (residues Leu-57 to Tyr-64), and alpha5 (residues Asn-67 to Cys-80). The N and C termini are disordered. This structure is unlike any other AMP structures described to date. We also used NMR spectroscopy to map the copper binding region on microplusin. Finally, using the Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus as a model, we studied of mode of action of microplusin. Microplusin has a bacteriostatic effect and does not permeabilize the bacterial membrane. Because microplusin binds metals, we tested whether this was related to its antimicrobial activity. We found that the bacteriostatic effect of microplusin was fully reversed by supplementation of culture media with copper II but not iron II. We also demonstrated that microplusin affects M. luteus respiration, a copper-dependent process. Thus, we conclude that the antibacterial effect of microplusin is due to its ability to bind and sequester copper II.},

abstract = {The solution structure of antimicrobial peptide tachystatin A from the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) was determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and distance-restrained simulated annealing calculations. The correct pairs of disulfide bonds were also confirmed in this study. The obtained structure has a cysteine-stabilized triple-stranded beta-sheet as a dominant secondary structure and shows an amphiphilic folding observed in many membrane-interactive peptides. Interestingly, tachystatin A shares structural similarities with the calcium channel antagonist omega-agatoxin IVA isolated from spider toxin and mammalian defensins, and we predicted that omega-agatoxin IVA also have the antifungal activity. These structural comparisons and functional correspondences suggest that tachystatin A and omega-agatoxin IVA may exert the antimicrobial activity in a manner similar to defensins, and we have confirmed such activity using fungal culture assays. Furthermore, tachystatin A is a chitin-binding peptide, and omega-agatoxin IVA also showed chitin-binding activities in this study. Tachystatin A and omega-agatoxin IVA showed no structural homology with well known chitin-binding motifs, suggesting that their structures belong to a novel family of chitin-binding peptides. Comparison of their structures with those of cellulose-binding proteins indicated that Phe(9) of tachystatin A might be an essential residue for binding to chitin.},

abstract = {Cationic antimicrobial peptides are naturally occurring antibiotics that are actively being explored as a new class of anti-infective agents. We recently identified three cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides from chicken, which have potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activities in vitro (Xiao Y, Cai Y, Bommineni YR, Fernando SC, Prakash O, Gilliland SE {\&} Zhang G (2006) J Biol Chem281, 2858-2867). Here we report that fowlicidin-1 mainly adopts an alpha-helical conformation with a slight kink induced by glycine close to the center, in addition to a short flexible unstructured region near the N terminus. To gain further insight into the structural requirements for function, a series of truncation and substitution mutants of fowlicidin-1 were synthesized and tested separately for their antibacterial, cytolytic and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding activities. The short C-terminal helical segment after the kink, consisting of a stretch of eight amino acids (residues 16-23), was shown to be critically involved in all three functions, suggesting that this region may be required for the peptide to interact with LPS and lipid membranes and to permeabilize both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. We also identified a second segment, comprising three amino acids (residues 5-7) in the N-terminal flexible region, that participates in LPS binding and cytotoxicity but is less important in bacterial killing. The fowlicidin-1 analog, with deletion of the second N-terminal segment (residues 5-7), was found to retain substantial antibacterial potency with a significant reduction in cytotoxicity. Such a peptide analog may have considerable potential for development as an anti-infective agent.},

abstract = {In invertebrates, defensins were found in arthropods and in the mussels. Here, we report for the first time the identification and characterization of a defensin (Cg-Def) from an oyster. Cg-def mRNA was isolated from Crassostrea gigas mantle using an expressed sequence tag approach. To gain insight into potential roles of Cg-Def in oyster immunity, we produced the recombinant peptide in Escherichia coli, characterized its antimicrobial activities, determined its solution structure by NMR spectroscopy, and quantified its gene expression in vivo following bacterial challenge of oysters. Recombinant Cg-Def was active in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria but showed no or limited activities against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The activity of Cg-Def was retained in vitro at a salt concentration similar to that of seawater. The Cg-Def structure shares the so-called cystine-stabilized alpha-beta motif (CS-alphabeta) with arthropod defensins but is characterized by the presence of an additional disulfide bond, as previously observed in the mussel defensin (MGD-1). Nevertheless, despite a similar global fold, the Cg-Def and MGD-1 structures mainly differ by the size of their loops and by the presence of two aspartic residues in Cg-Def. Distribution of Cg-def mRNA in various oyster tissues revealed that Cg-def is mainly expressed in mantle edge where it was detected by mass spectrometry analyses. Furthermore, we observed that the Cg-def messenger concentration was unchanged after bacterial challenge. Our results suggest that Cg-def gene is continuously expressed in the mantle and would play a key role in oyster by providing a first line of defense against pathogen colonization.},

abstract = {An antibacterial peptide was isolated from a lepidopteran insect, Spodoptera litura. The molecular mass of this peptide was determined to be 4489.55 by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass (MALDI-TOF MS) spectrometry. The peptide consists of 42 amino acids and the sequence has 69-98{\%} identity to those of moricin-related peptides, antibacterial peptides from lepidopetran insects. Thus, the peptide was designated S. litura (Sl) moricin. Sl moricin showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against Gram-positive and negative bacteria. Sl moricin gene was inducible by bacterial injection and expressed tissue-specifically in the fat body and hemocytes. Furthermore, the solution structure of Sl moricin was determined by two-dimensional (2D) 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing calculation. The tertiary structure revealed a long alpha-helix containing eight turns along nearly the full length of the peptide like that of moricin, confirming that Sl moricin is a new moricin-like antibacterial peptide. These results suggest that moricin is present not only in B. mori but also in other lepidopteran insects forming a gene family.},

abstract = {Phylloseptins are antimicrobial peptides of 19-20 residues which are found in the skin secretions of the Phyllomedusa frogs that inhabit the tropical forests of South and Central Americas. The peptide sequences of PS-1, -2, and -3 carry an amidated C-terminus and they exhibit 74{\%} sequence homology with major variations of only four residues close to the C-terminus. Here we investigated and compared the structures of the three phylloseptins in detail by CD- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopies in the presence of phospholipid vesicles or in membrane-mimetic environments. Both CD and NMR spectroscopies reveal a high degree of helicity in the order PS-2{\textgreater} or =PS-1{\textgreater}PS-3, where the differences accumulate at the C-terminus. The conformational variations can be explained by taking into consideration electrostatic interactions of the negative ends of the helix dipoles with potentially cationic residues at positions 17 and 18. Whereas two are present in the sequence of PS-1 and -2 only one is present in PS-3. In conclusion, the antimicrobial phylloseptin peptides adopt alpha-helical conformations in membrane environments which are stabilized by electrostatic interactions of the helix dipole as well as other contributions such hydrophobic and capping interactions.},

Using a forward primer that was designed from a conserved region of the 5'-untranslated regions of Rana temporaria preprotemporins in a 3'-RACE procedure, a cDNA clone encoding preprotemporin-1SKa was prepared from R. sakuraii skin total RNA. Further preprotemporin cDNAs encoding temporin-1SKc (AVDLAKIANIAN KVLSSL F x NH2) and temporin-1SKd (FLPMLAKLLSGFL x NH2) were obtained by RT-PCR. Unexpectedly, the 3'-RACE procedure using the same primer led to amplification of a cDNA encoding a preprobradykinin whose signal peptide region was identical to that of preprotemporin-1SKa except for the substitution Ser18--{\textgreater}Asn. R. sakuraii bradykinin ([Arg0,Leu1,Thr6,Trp8] BK) was 28-fold less potent than mammalian BK in effecting B2 receptor-mediated relaxation of mouse trachea and the des[Arg0] derivative was only a weak partial agonist. The evolutionary history of the Japanese brown frogs is incompletely understood but a comparison of the primary structures of the R. sakuraii dermal peptides with those of Tago's brown frog Rana tagoi provides evidence for a close phylogenetic relationship between these species.},

abstract = {As a key component of the innate immunity system, human cathelicidin LL-37 plays an essential role in protecting humans against infectious diseases. To elucidate the structural basis for its targeting bacterial membrane, we have determined the high quality structure of (13)C,(15)N-labeled LL-37 by three-dimensional triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy, because two-dimensional (1)H NMR did not provide sufficient spectral resolution. The structure of LL-37 in SDS micelles is composed of a curved amphipathic helix-bend-helix motif spanning residues 2-31 followed by a disordered C-terminal tail. The helical bend is located between residues Gly-14 and Glu-16. Similar chemical shifts and (15)N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) patterns of the peptide in complex with dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol (D8PG) micelles indicate a similar structure. The aromatic rings of Phe-5, Phe-6, Phe-17, and Phe-27 of LL-37, as well as arginines, showed intermolecular NOE cross-peaks with D8PG, providing direct evidence for the association of the entire amphipathic helix with anionic lipid micelles. The structure of LL-37 serves as a model for understanding the structure and function relationship of homologous primate cathelicidins. Using synthetic peptides, we also identified the smallest antibacterial peptide KR-12 corresponding to residues 18-29 of LL-37. Importantly, KR-12 displayed a selective toxic effect on bacteria but not human cells. NMR structural analysis revealed a short three-turn amphipathic helix rich in positively charged side chains, allowing for effective competition for anionic phosphatidylglycerols in bacterial membranes. KR-12 may be a useful peptide template for developing novel antimicrobial agents of therapeutic use.},

Pth-St1 was also active against other potato pathogens tested (Pseudomonas solanacearum and Fusarium solani). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this peptide was identical (except for a N/H substitution at position 2) to that deduced from a previously reported cDNA sequence (EMBL accession number X-13180), which had been misclassified as a Browman-Birk protease inhibitor. Pth-St1 did not inhibit either trypsin or insect alpha-amylase activities, and, in contrast with true thionins, did not affect cell-free protein synthesis or beta-glucuronidase activity. Northern-blot and tissue-print analyses showed that steady-state mRNA levels were highest in flowers (especially in petals), followed by tubers (especially in the epidermal cell layers and in leaf primordia), stems and leaves. Infection of leaves with a bacterial pathogen suspended in 10 mM MgCl2 switched off the gene, whereas mock inoculation with 10 mM MgCl2 alone induced higher mRNA levels.},

Three novel cathelicidin sequences were deduced from bone marrow mRNA and designated equine cathelicidins eCATH-1, eCATH-2 and eCATH-3. Putative antimicrobial domains of 26, 27 and 40 residues with no significant sequence homology to other peptides were inferred at the C-terminus of the sequences. Southern analysis of genomic DNA using a probe based on the cathelicidin-conserved propiece revealed a polymorphic DNA region with several hybridization-positive fragments and suggested the presence of additional genes. A null eCATH-1 allele was also demonstrated with a frequency of 0.71 in the horse population analyzed and low amounts of eCATH-1-specific mRNA were found in myeloid cells of gene-positive animals. A Western analysis using antibodies to synthetic eCATH peptides revealed the presence of eCATH-2 and eCATH-3 propeptides, but not of eCATH-1-related polypeptides, in horse neutrophil granules and in the secretions of phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated neutrophils. These results thus suggest that eCATH-2 and eCATH-3 are functional genes, whereas eCATH-1 is unable to encode a polypeptide.},

abstract = {Seven peptides (XT-1-XT-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, Xenopus tropicalis. Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from Xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. Peptides XT-5 and XT-3 are probably the orthologs of X. laevis peptide glycine-leucine amide (PGL(a)) and the N-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. XT-1, XT-6 and XT-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of X. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs XT-2 and XT-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. Orthologs of the magainins were not identified. The C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide XT-7 (GLLGPLLKIAAKVGSNLL.NH2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus 5 microM, Escherichia coli 5 microM, and Candida albicans 40 microM) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus group C, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. The peptide was, however, hemolytic against human erythrocytes (50{\%} lysis at 70 microM). Circular dichroism studies showed that XT-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, pH 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50{\%} trifluoroethanol. Decreasing the cationicity of XT-7 either by replacement of the C-terminal CONH2 group by COOH or by deletion of the Lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly ({\textgreater}10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.},

In this report, we present the isolation, structural characterization, and biological properties of two variants of a group of bioactive, slightly cationic peptides, referred to as alloferons. Two peptides were isolated from the blood of an experimentally infected insect, the blow fly Calliphora vicina (Diptera), with the following amino acid sequences: HGVSGHGQHGVHG (alloferon 1) and GVSGHGQHGVHG (alloferon 2). Although these peptides have no clear homologies with known immune response modifiers, protein database searches established some structural similarities with proteins containing amino acid stretches similar to alloferon. In vitro experiments reveal that the synthetic version of alloferon has stimulatory activities on natural killer lymphocytes, whereas in vivo trials indicate induction of IFN production in mice after treatments with synthetic alloferon. Additional in vivo experiments in mice indicate that alloferon has antiviral and antitumoral capabilities. Taken together, these results suggest that this peptide, which has immunomodulatory properties, may have therapeutic capacities. The fact that insects may produce cytokine-like materials modulating basic mechanisms for human immunity suggests a source of anti-infection and antitumoral biopharmaceuticals.},

abstract = {Peptidomics and genomics analyses were used to study an anti-infection array of peptides of amphibian skin. 372 cDNA sequences of antimicrobial peptides were characterized from a single individual skin of the frog Odorrana grahami that encode 107 novel antimicrobial peptides. This contribution almost triples the number of currently reported amphibian antimicrobial peptides. The peptides could be organized into 30 divergent groups, including 24 novel groups. The diversity in peptide coding cDNA sequences is, to our knowledge, the most extreme yet described for any animal. The patterns of diversification suggest that point mutations as well as insertion, deletion, and "shuffling" of oligonucleotide sequences were responsible for the diversity. The diversity of antimicrobial peptides may have resulted from the diversity of microorganisms. These diverse peptides exhibited both diverse secondary structure and "host defense" properties. Such extreme antimicrobial peptide diversity in a single amphibian species is amazing. This has led us to reconsider the strong capability of innate immunity and molecular genetics of amphibian ecological diversification and doubt the general opinion that 20-30 different antimicrobial peptides can protect an animal because of the relatively wide specificity of the peptide antibiotics. The antimicrobial mechanisms of O. grahami peptides were investigated. They exerted their antimicrobial functions by various means, including forming lamellar mesosome-like structures, peeling off the cell walls, forming pores, and inducing DNA condensation. With respect to the development of antibiotics, these peptides provide potential new templates to explore further.},

In this paper, several mastoparans from the venom of the wasp Vespa magnifica (Smith) are reported. The cDNA of mastoparanogen is 236 base pairs in length, and encodes 40 amino acid residues, including a N-terminal acidic fragment and a C-terminal mature basic mastoparan, which contain multiple acidic amino acid residues and a tetradecapeptide with three lysines, INLKAIAALAKKLLG, respectively. The glycine at the tetradecapeptide end is the donator of -NH(4) for the amidation of the leucine at the C-terminal. As far as we know, this is the first report of the precursor of animal mastoparan.},

abstract = {IsCT is a non-cell-selective antimicrobial peptide isolated from the scorpion Opisthacanthus madagascariensis that has potent cytolytic activity against both mammalian and bacterial cells. To investigate the structure-activity relationships of IsCT and to design novel peptide antibiotics with bacterial cell selectivity, we synthesized several analogs of IsCT and determined their three-dimensional structures in solution by 2D-NMR spectroscopy. IsCT has a linear alpha-helical structure from Gly3 to Phe13, and [K7]-IsCT has a linear alpha-helical structure from Leu2 to Phe13. [K7, P8, K11]-IsCT, which has a bend in its middle region, exhibited the highest antibacterial activity without hemolytic activity, suggesting that its proline-induced bend is an important determinant of this selectivity. Tryptophan fluorescence showed that the high selectivity of [K7, P8, K11]-IsCT toward bacterial cells is closely correlated with its highly selective interaction with negatively charged phospholipids. Its potent activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria suggests that [K7, P8, K11]-IsCT may serve as a promising lead candidate in the development of new peptide antibiotics.},

Two-dimensional 1H-1H and 1H-13C NMR spectroscopy in trifluoroethanol/H2O (50:50, by vol.) have been used to assign the 1H and 13C-NMR spectra of this 25-amino-acid peptide. From an examination of these data, and using distance geometry and molecular dynamics calculations, the solution conformation of caerin 1.1 has been determined. The peptide adopts two well-defined helices from Leu2 to Lys11 and from Val17 to His24 separated by a region of less-defined helicity and greater flexibility. Overall, the peptide has a distinct amphipathic charge distribution. The solution structure of caerin 1.1 is compared with activity data against a variety of micro-organisms for the parent peptide and some naturally occurring and synthetic variants of caerin 1.1. The structural and activity data are consistent with caerin 1.1 interacting with membranes in a similar manner to other antimicrobial peptides, i.e. via a carpet-like mechanism whereby the individual peptides aggregate in a helical manner and orient themselves parallel to the membrane in a sheet-like arrangement [Shai, Y. (1995) Trends Biochem. Sci. 20, 460-464].},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides are widely distributed in nature and appear to play a role in the host defense of plants and animals. In this study we report the existence of antimicrobial peptides in the stomach of the vertebrate Xenopus laevis, an animal previously shown to store high concentrations of antimicrobial peptides in its skin. Antimicrobial activity was detected in extracts of X. laevis stomach tissue and nine antimicrobial peptides were then purified. A novel 24-amino acid peptide, designated PGQ, was isolated from these extracts, and has the following amino acid sequence: GVLSNVIGYLKKLGTGALNAVLKQ. PGQ is relatively basic and has the potential to form an amphipathic alpha-helix. The other peptides isolated are members of the magainin family of antimicrobial peptides, and include magainins I and II, PGLa, xenopsin precursor fragment, and four caerulein precursor fragments. None of these peptides had been previously identified in tissues other than the skin. The purification of the peptides from stomach extracts and subsequent protein sequence analysis reveals that the peptides have undergone the same processing as their dermal counterparts, and that they are stored in their processed forms. Northern blot analysis indicates that the magainin family of peptides are synthesized in the stomach, and immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that magainin is stored in a novel granular multinucleated cell in the gastric mucosa of Xenopus. This study demonstrates that the magainin family of antimicrobial peptides is found in the gastrointestinal system of X. laevis and offers an opportunity to further define the physiological role of these defense peptides.},

abstract = {A 34-amino acid peptide and three other structurally related peptides were isolated from rabbit fetal and adult lung. These cationic arginine- and cysteine-rich peptides inhibit corticotropin (ACTH)-stimulated rat adrenal cell corticosterone production. The peptide was called corticostatin (CSI). CSI was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and was shown to be homogenous from its amino acid analysis. Its sequence was determined on a gas-phase sequenator. The structure of CSI is Gly-Ile-Cys-Ala-Cys-Arg-Arg-Arg-Phe-Cys-Pro-Asn-Ser-Glu-Arg-Phe-Ser-Gly- Tyr-Cys - Arg-Val-Asn-Gly-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Val-Arg-Cys-Cys-Ser-Arg-Arg. CSI was found to markedly inhibit ACTH-stimulated corticosterone production by rat adrenal cells in vitro but did not affect basal levels. CSI did not affect the stimulation of aldosterone synthesis by angiotensin II in rat zona glomerulosa cells but it did suppress ACTH-stimulated aldosterone synthesis in whole adrenal cells, demonstrating that CSI is a specific inhibitor of ACTH-stimulated corticosteroid synthesis. The minimum effective concentration of CSI inhibiting ACTH-stimulated (33 pM) corticosterone production was 5 nM (20 ng/ml), the ED50 (50{\%} effective dose) was 25 nM and steroidogenesis was completely inhibited at concentrations greater than 500 nM (2 micrograms/ml).},

abstract = {Antibacterial glycopeptides isolated from insects are exciting bio-oligomers because they represent a family of compounds in which the structural and functional effects of incorporating short O-linked sugars to protein fragments can be studied. Additionally, their high activity in vitro warrants detailed further drug development efforts. Due to the limited availability of the isolated material, we used synthetic glycopeptides and some analogs to investigate the range of activity of drosocin and pyrrhocoricin. While addition of the Gal-GalNAc disaccharide to the natural mid-chain position generally increased the antibacterial activity of drosocin, pyrrhocoricin lacking sugar appeared to be more potent, with an IC50 against Escherichia coli D22 of 150 nM. Although glycosylated drosocin was active against E. coli in the low microM range in vitro, this peptide was completely inactive when injected into mice. The lack of in vivo activity of drosocin could be explained by the unusually high degradation rate of the peptides in mammalian sera. The early degradation products were inactive in vitro. In contrast, the peptides were considerably more stable in insect hemolymph, where their natural activity is manifested.},

abstract = {A novel family of peptide precursors that have very similar N-terminal preprosequences followed by markedly different C-terminal domains has been identified in the skin of hylid frogs belonging to the genus Phyllomedusinae. Biologically active peptides derived from the variable domains include the dermaseptins, 28-34-residue peptides that have a broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, and dermorphin and the deltorphins, D-amino acid containing heptapeptides that are very potent agonists for the micro-opioid and delta-opioid receptors, respectively. This report describes the isolation, synthesis and cloning of phylloxin, a prototypical member of a novel family of antimicrobial peptides derived from the processing of a dermaseptin/dermorphin-like precursor. The structure of phylloxin (GWMSKIASGIGTFLSGIQQ amide) shows no homology to the dermaseptins, but bears some resemblance to the levitide-precursor fragment and the xenopsin-precursor fragment, two antimicrobial peptides isolated from the skin of an evolutionarily distant frog species, Xenopus laevis. Circular dichroism spectra of phylloxin in low polarity medium, which mimics the lipophilicity of the membrane of target microorganisms, indicated 60-70{\%} alpha-helical conformation, and predictions of secondary structure suggested that the peptide can be configured as an amphipathic helix spanning residues 1-19. Phylloxin is an addition to the structurally and functionally diverse peptide families encoded by the rapidly evolving C-terminal domains of the dermorphin/dermaseptin group of precursors.},

These peptides are predicted to operate as a first-line host defense mechanism exerting broad-spectrum activity against pathogenic bacteria, fungi, parasites, and enveloped viruses. We report the characterization of a novel 25-residue linear antimicrobial peptide found in the skin mucous secretions of the winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). This peptide was purified through multiple chromatographic methods to obtain a single peak by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. This purified peptide, which we named pleurocidin, exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli in a bacterial cell lysis plate assay. Mass spectrometry and amino acid sequence analysis indicated that it is 25 amino acids in length. Pleurocidin is predicted to assume an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation similar to many other linear antimicrobial peptides. There is a high degree of homology between pleurocidin and two antimicrobial peptides, ceratotoxin from the Mediterranean fruit fly and dermaseptin from the skin of a hylid frog. The minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of pleurocidin were determined against 11 different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Immunohistochemistry locates pleurocidin in the epithelial mucous cells of flounder skin. Pleurocidin represents a novel antimicrobial peptide found in fish and may play a role in innate host defense.},

To date, 6 dermaseptin B mature peptides, 24-34 residues long, 2 dermaseptin B cDNAs and 2 gene sequences have been identified in P. bicolor. To assess dermaseptin related genes further, we screened a P. bicolor genomic library with 32P-labeled cDNAs coding either for prepro-dermaseptins B1 or B2 (adenoregulin). A gene sequence was identified that coded a novel dermaseptin B, termed Drg3, which exhibits 23-42{\%} amino acids identities with other members of the family. Analysis of the cDNAs coding precursors for several opioid and antimicrobial peptides originating from the skin of various amphibian species revealed that the 25-residue preproregion of these preproforms are all encoded by conserved nucleotides encompassed by the first coding exon of the Drg3 gene. Synthetic dermaseptin Drg3 exhibited a bactericidal activity towards several species of mollicutes (wall-less eubacteria), firmicutes (Gram-positive eubacteria), and gracilicutes (Gram-negative eubacteria), with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 6.25 to 100 microM.

This peptide, porcine cecropin P1, which has 31 amino acid residues and is not amidated in the C-terminus, has been synthesized, purified, and investigated by CD and two-dimensional 1H-NMR at pH 5.0 in aqueous solution with 30{\%} (by vol.) 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. All proton resonances have been assigned except for the N-terminal serine. Using constraints derived from NOE connectivities and 3JNH alpha-coupling constants, three-dimensional structures have been calculated by means of a distance-geometry program. Some of these structures have been refined by energy minimization and restrained molecular dynamics. The structures reveal an alpha-helix of approximately seven turns along nearly the full length of the peptide. The central part of the helix is very well defined by the NMR constraints. Also the chemical shifts of the alpha protons and the results of CD measurements are in accord with this structure, which is different from the helix-hinge-helix structure earlier found in cecropin A and related peptides. In the alpha-helix of cecropin P1 there is a long amphipathic section, of 4-5 turns, and a short hydrophobic section of one to two turns, with an intervening Glu-Gly sequence, which is a potential bend-forming section. The helix can easily span a lipid membrane.},

In common with other cytolytic peptides from Ranid frogs, (e.g. ranalexin, gaegurins, brevinins), ranatuerins 1 and 4 contain an intramolecular disulfide bridge forming a heptapeptide ring whereas in ranatuerins 2 and 3 the disulfide bridge forms a hexapeptide ring. The structurally related ranatuerins 5-9 comprise 12 - 14 amino acids and show sequence similarity towards the hemolytic peptides A1 and B9 previously isolated from the skin of Rana esculenta. Of the peptides purified, ranatuerin 1 (SMLSVLKNLGKVGLG FVACKINKQC) showed the broadest spectrum of antimicrobial action with inhibitory activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans.},

The present research deals with the identification of peptides isolated from the skin secretion of the Marsh frog R. ridibunda inhabiting the Kolkhida Canyon of the Caucasian region. The research is based on comprehensive high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) analysis of intact and chemically modified peptides. In particular, an oxidation procedure was applied directly to the crude skin secretion to open S--S loops whereas N-terminal acetylation was additionally carried out for one individual peptide. Sequences were determined by manual interpretation of electron capture dissociation (ECD) and collisionally induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectra. A total of 29 peptides were identified in the skin secretion of the Caucasian Marsh frog. The peptide profile is represented with disulfide-containing peptides belonging to the brevinin, esculentin and ranatuerin families, neuropeptides of the bradykinin and bombesin families. Two identified peptides belonging to the ranatuerins are the first peptides of this family discovered in the skin secretions of European frogs. Ten of the identified peptides coincide with those reported earlier for the European Edible frog. Another ten are identical to those found in R. ridubunda from the Moscow region. This fact verifies the described method as being an efficient analytical tool to compare intra- and interspecific variabilities.},

abstract = {Saponins are a class of compounds containing a triterpenoid or steroid core with some attached carbohydrate modules. Many saponins cause hemolysis. However, the hemolytic mechanism of saponins at the molecular level is not yet fully understood. In an attempt to explore this issue, we have studied dioscin-a saponin with high hemolytic activity-through extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Firstly, all-atom MD simulations of 8 ns duration were conducted to study the stability of the dioscin-cholesterol complex and the cholesterol-cholesterol complex in water and in decane, respectively. MM-GB/SA computations indicate that the dioscin-cholesterol complex is energetically more favorable than the cholesterol-cholesterol complex in a non-polar environment. Next, several coarse-grained MD simulations of 400 ns duration were conducted to directly observe the distribution of multiple dioscin molecules on a DPPC-POPC-PSM-CHOL lipid bilayer. Our results indicate that dioscin can penetrate into the lipid bilayer, accumulate in the lipid raft micro-domain, and then bind cholesterol. This leads to the destabilization of lipid raft and consequent membrane curvature, which may eventually result in the hemolysis of red cells. This possible mechanism of hemolysis can well explain some experimental observations on hemolysis.},

To this end, computational studies on the interaction of known membrane-active antimicrobial polymers with phospholipid bilayers reveal spontaneous membrane insertion and cooperative action at low and high concentrations, respectively. In late-stage attack, antimicrobials cross the membrane core and occasionally align to provide a stepping-stone pathway for water permeation; this suggests a possible new mode of action that does not depend on pore formation for transport to and across the inner leaflet. The computations rationalize the observed activity of a new class of antimicrobial compounds.},

The success of antibacterial agents depends upon their interaction with bacterial membranes, yet little is known about the molecular-level interactions within membranes of different bacterial species. To address this, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of two bacterial membranes: the outer membrane of E. coli and the cell membrane of S. aureus . We have retained the chemical complexity of the membranes by considering the details of their lipidic components. We identify the extended network of lipid-lipid interactions that stabilize the membranes. Our simulations of electroporation show that the S. aureus cell membrane is less resistant to poration than the E. coli outer membrane. The mechanisms of poration for the two membranes have subtle differences; for the E. coli outer membrane, relative differences in mobilities of the lipids of both leaflets are key in the process of poration.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics trajectories of melittin in an explicit dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer are generated to study the details of lipid-protein interactions at the microscopic level. Melittin, a small amphipathic peptide found in bee venom, is known to have a pronounced effect on the lysis of membranes. The peptide is initially set parallel to the membrane-solution interfacial region in an alpha-helical conformation with unprotonated N-terminus. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and polarized attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared (PATIR-FTIR) properties of melittin are calculated from the trajectory to characterize the orientation of the peptide relative to the bilayer. The residue Lys7 located in the hydrophobic moiety of the helix and residues Lys23, Arg24, Gln25, and Gln26 at the C-terminus hydrophilic form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and with the ester carbonyl groups of the lipids, suggesting their important contribution to the stability of the helix in the bilayer. Lipid acyl chains are closely packed around melittin, contributing to the stable association with the membrane. Calculated density profiles and order parameters of the lipid acyl chains averaged over the molecular dynamics trajectory indicate that melittin has effects on both layers of the membrane. The presence of melittin in the upper layer causes a local thinning of the bilayer that favors the penetration of water through the lower layer. The energetic factors involved in the association of melittin at the membrane surface are characterized using an implicit mean-field model in which the membrane and the surrounding solvent are represented as structureless continuum dielectric material. The results obtained by solving the Poisson-Bolztmann equation numerically are in qualitative agreement with the detailed dynamics. The influence of the protonation state of the N-terminus of melittin is examined. After 600 ps, the N-terminus of melittin is protonated and the trajectory is continued for 400 ps, which leads to an important penetration of water molecules into the bilayer. These observations provide insights into how melittin interacts with membranes and the mechanism by which it enhances their lysis.},

Special attention was devoted to reproduce the correct density of the lipid, because this quantity is known experimentally with a precision better than 1{\%}. For this purpose, the Lennard-Jones parameters of the hydrocarbon chains were adjusted by simulating a system consisting of 128 pentadecane molecules and varying the Lennard-Jones parameters until the experimental density and heat of vaporization were obtained. With these parameters the lipid density resulted in perfect agreement with the experimental density. The orientational order parameter of the hydrocarbon chains agreed perfectly well with the experimental values, which, because of its correlation with the area per lipid, makes it possible to give a proper estimate of the area per lipid of 0.61 +/- 0.01 nm2.},

abstract = {A hydrated bilayer of the phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (DMPC) has been studied in the course of a molecular dynamics simulation. Comparison of the simulation results with experiment indicates that generally the two agree well. Data are presented concerning all the major system regions, including the hydrocarbon chains, the glycerol region, the lipid headgroups and the hydrating water molecules. The simulations suggest that this model can be extended to the study of more complex systems of greater biochemical interest, such as membrane bound proteins.},

abstract = {We present the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a phospholipid membrane in water, including full atomic detail. The goal of the simulations was twofold: first we wanted to set up a simulation system which is able to reproduce experimental results and can serve as a model membrane in future simulations. This goal being reached it is then further possible to gain insight in to those properties that are experimentally more difficult to access. The system studied is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/water, consisting of 5408 atoms. Using original force field parameters the membrane turned out to approach a gel-like state. With slight changes of the parameters, the system adopted a liquid-crystalline state. Separate 80 ps runs were performed on both the gel and liquid-crystalline systems. Comparison of MD results with reliable experimental data (bilayer repeat distance, surface area per lipid, tail order parameters, atom distributions) showed that our simulations, especially the one in the liquid-crystalline phase, can serve as a realistic model for a phospholipid membrane. Further analysis of the trajectories revealed valuable information on various properties. In the liquid-crystalline phase, the interface turns out to be quite diffuse, with water molecules penetrating into the bilayer to the position of the carbonyl groups. The 10-90{\%} width of the interface turns out to be 1.3 nm and the width of the hydrocarbon interior 3.0 nm. The headgroup dipoles are oriented at a small angle with respect to the bilayer plane. The resulting charge distribution is almost completely cancelled by the water molecules. The electron density distribution shows a large dip in the middle of the membrane. In this part the tails are more flexible. The mean life time between dihedral transitions is 20 ps. The average number of gauche angles per tail is 3.5. The occurrence of kinks is not a significant feature.},

abstract = {Establishing the ancestral ranges of distribution of a monophyletic clade, called the ancestral area, is one of the central objectives of historical biogeography. In this study, I used three common methodologies to establish the ancestral area of an important clade of Neotropical lizards, the family Liolaemidae. The methods used were: Fitch optimization, Weighted Ancestral Area Analysis and Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis (DIVA). A main difference from previous studies is that the areas used in the analysis are defined based on actual distributions of the species of Liolaemidae, instead of areas defined arbitrarilyor based on other taxa. The ancestral area of Liolaemidae found by Fitch optimization is Prepuna on Argentina, Central Chile and Coastal Peru. Weighted Ancestral Area Analysis found Central Chile, Coquimbo, Payunia, Austral Patagonia and Coastal Peru. Dispersal-Vicariance analysis found an ancestral area that includes almost all the areas occupied by Liolaemidae, except Atacama, Coquimbo and Austral Patagonia. The results can be resumed on two opposing hypothesis: a restricted ancestral area for the ancestor of Liolaemidae in Central Chile and Patagonia, or a widespread ancestor distributed along the Andes. Some limitations of the methods were identified, for example the excessive importance of plesiomorphic areas in the cladograms.},

abstract = {Haloalkane dehalogenase (DhlA) was used as a model protein to explore the possibility to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a tool to identify flexible regions in proteins that can serve as a target for stability enhancement by introduction of a disulfide bond. DhlA consists of two domains: an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold main domain and a cap domain composed of five alpha-helices. MD simulations of DhlA showed high mobility in a helix-loop-helix region in the cap domain, involving residues 184-211. A disulfide cross-link was engineered between residue 201 of this flexible region and residue 16 of the main domain. The mutant enzyme showed substantial changes in both thermal and urea denaturation. The oxidized form of the mutant enzyme showed an increase of the apparent transition temperature from 47.5 to 52.5 degrees C, whereas the T(m,app) of the reduced mutant decreased by more than 8 degrees C compared to the wild-type enzyme. Urea denaturation results showed a similar trend. Measurement of the kinetic stability showed that the introduction of the disulfide bond caused a decrease in activation free energy of unfolding of 0.43 kcal mol(-1) compared to the wild-type enzyme and also indicated that the helix-loop-helix region was involved early in the unfolding process. The results show that MD simulations are capable of identifying mobile protein domains that can successfully be used as a target for stability enhancement by the introduction of a disulfide cross-link.},

abstract = {To efficiently insert a protein into an equilibrated and fully hydrated membrane with minimal membrane perturbation we present a computational tool, called g{\_}membed, which is part of the Gromacs suite of programs. The input consists of an equilibrated membrane system, either flat or curved, and a protein structure in the right position and orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer. g{\_}membed first decreases the width of the protein in the xy-plane and removes all molecules (generally lipids and waters) that overlap with the narrowed protein. Then the protein is grown back to its full size in a short molecular dynamics simulation (typically 1000 steps), thereby pushing the lipids away to optimally accommodate the protein in the membrane. After embedding the protein in the membrane, both the lipid properties and the hydration layer are still close to equilibrium. Thus, only a short equilibration run (less then 1 ns in the cases tested) is required to re-equilibrate the membrane. Its simplicity makes g{\_}membed very practical for use in scripting and high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have become a popular and powerful technique to study lipids and membrane proteins. We present some general questions and issues that should be considered prior to embarking on molecular dynamics simulation studies of membrane proteins and review common simulation methods. We suggest a practical approach to setting up and running simulations of membrane proteins, and introduce two new (related) methods to embed a protein in a lipid bilayer. Both methods rely on placing lipids and the protein(s) on a widely spaced grid and then 'shrinking' the grid until the bilayer with the protein has the desired density, with lipids neatly packed around the protein. When starting from a grid based on a single lipid structure, or several potentially different lipid structures (method 1), the bilayer will start well-packed but requires more equilibration. When starting from a pre-equilibrated bilayer, either pure or mixed, most of the structure of the bilayer stays intact, reducing equilibration time (method 2). The main advantages of these methods are that they minimize equilibration time and can be almost completely automated, nearly eliminating one time consuming step in MD simulations of membrane proteins.},

To probe the biophysical characteristics that confer activity, we present here a molecular-dynamics and biophysical study of a cyclic antimicrobial peptide and its inactive linear analog. In the simulations, the cyclic peptide caused large perturbations in the bilayer and cooperatively opened a disordered toroidal pore, 1-2 nm in diameter. Electrophysiology measurements confirm discrete poration events of comparable size. We also show that lysine residues aligning parallel to each other in the cyclic but not linear peptide are crucial for function. By employing dual-color fluorescence burst analysis, we show that both peptides are able to fuse/aggregate liposomes but only the cyclic peptide is able to porate them. The results provide detailed insight on the molecular basis of activity of cyclic antimicrobial peptides.},

To improve the antibacterial activity and to reduce toxicity, mutants Pis-1AA (G8A/G13A double mutant) and Pis-1PG (G8P mutant) have been designed based on the crystal structure of Pis-1. Eighteen independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pis-1 and its mutants with membranes are conducted in this article. Furthermore, 60 independent MD simulations of three peptides in water box have also been discussed for comparison. The results indicate that the unfolding process starts at the middle of the peptide. Pis-1 disrupts easily in the region of Val10-Lys14. Pis-1PG has a flexible N-terminal region, and the interaction between N-terminal and C-terminal is very weak. Pis-1AA has the most stable helical structure. In addition, percentage of native contacts and hydrogen bonds analysis are also performed. Lipid-peptide interaction analysis suggests that Pis-1 and Pis-1AA has a stronger interaction with the zwitterionic dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer than Pis-1PG. When compared with the results of peptide with membrane, peptides are unstable and unfolding quickly in water solution. Our results are applicable in examining diversities on hemolytic, antibacterial, and selectivity of antimicrobial peptides.},

The interaction of antimicrobial peptides with the cellular membrane of bacteria is the key step of their mechanism of action. Fluorescence spectroscopy can provide several structural details on peptide-membrane systems, such as partition free energy, aggregation state, peptide position and orientation in the bilayer, and the effects of the peptides on the membrane order. However, these "low-resolution" structural data are hardly sufficient to define the structural requirements for the pore formation process. Molecular dynamics simulations, on the other hand, provide atomic-level information on the structure and dynamics of the peptide-membrane system, but they need to be validated experimentally. In this review we summarize the information that can be obtained by both approaches, highlighting their versatility and complementarity, suggesting that their synergistic application could lead to a new level of insight into the mechanism of membrane destabilization by AMPs.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides have been isolated and characterized from tissues and organisms representing virtually every kingdom and phylum, ranging from prokaryotes to humans. Yet, recurrent structural and functional themes in mechanisms of action and resistance are observed among peptides of widely diverse source and composition. Biochemical distinctions among the peptides themselves, target versus host cells, and the microenvironments in which these counterparts convene, likely provide for varying degrees of selective toxicity among diverse antimicrobial peptide types. Moreover, many antimicrobial peptides employ sophisticated and dynamic mechanisms of action to effect rapid and potent activities consistent with their likely roles in antimicrobial host defense. In balance, successful microbial pathogens have evolved multifaceted and effective countermeasures to avoid exposure to and subvert mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides. A clearer recognition of these opposing themes will significantly advance our understanding of how antimicrobial peptides function in defense against infection. Furthermore, this understanding may provide new models and strategies for developing novel antimicrobial agents, that may also augment immunity, restore potency or amplify the mechanisms of conventional antibiotics, and minimize antimicrobial resistance mechanisms among pathogens. From these perspectives, the intention of this review is to illustrate the contemporary structural and functional themes among mechanisms of antimicrobial peptide action and resistance.},

abstract = {It has long been suggested that pore formation is responsible for the increase in membrane permeability by antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). To better understand the mechanism of AMP activity, the disruption of model membrane by protegrin-1 (PG-1), a cationic antimicrobial peptide, was studied using atomic force microscopy. We present here the direct visualization of the full range of structural transformations in supported lipid bilayer patches induced by PG-1 on zwitterionic 1,2-dimyristoyl-snglycero-phospho-choline (DMPC) membranes. When PG-1 is added to DMPC, the peptide first induces edge instability at low concentrations, then pore-like surface defects at intermediate concentrations, and finally wormlike structures with a specific length scale at high concentrations. The formation of these structures can be understood using a mesophase framework of a binary mixture of lipids and peptides, where PG-1 acts as a line-active agent. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on lipid bilayer ribbons with PG-1 molecules placed at the edge or interior positions are carried out to calculate the effect of PG-1 in reducing line tension. Further investigation of the placement of PG-1 and its association with defects in the bilayer is carried out using unbiased assembly of a PG-1 containing bilayer from a random mixture of PG-1, DMPC, and water. A generalized model of AMP induced structural transformations is also presented in this work. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane protein structure and function.},

abstract = {In spite of great advances in cancer therapy, there is considerable current interest in developing anticancer agents with a new mode of action because of the development of resistance by cancer cells towards current anticancer drugs. A growing number of studies have shown that some of the cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are toxic to bacteria but not to normal mammalian cells, exhibit a broad spectrum of cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. Such studies have considerably enhanced the significance of AMPs, both synthetic and from natural sources, which have been of importance both for an increased understanding of the immune system and for their potential as clinical antibiotics. The electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged components of bacterial and cancer cells and the positively charged AMPs is believed to play a major role in the strong binding and selective disruption of bacterial and cancer cell membranes, respectively. However, it is unclear why some host defense peptides are able to kill cancer cells when others do not. In addition, it is not clear whether the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the antibacterial and anticancer activities of AMPs are the same or different. In this article, we review various studies on different AMPs that exhibit cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. The suitability of cancer cell-targeting AMPs as cancer therapeutics is also discussed.},

abstract = {Hydrophobic mismatch, which is the difference between the hydrophobic length of trans-membrane segments of a protein and the hydrophobic width of the surrounding lipid bilayer, is known to play a role in membrane protein function. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of trans-membrane KALP peptides (sequence: GKK(LA)nLKKA) in phospholipid bilayers to investigate hydrophobic mismatch alleviation mechanisms. By varying systematically the length of the peptide (KALP15, KALP19, KALP23, KALP27, and KALP31) and the lipid hydrophobic length (DLPC, DMPC, and DPPC), a wide range of mismatch conditions were studied. Simulations of durations of 50-200 ns show that under positive mismatch, the system alleviates the mismatch predominantly by tilting the peptide and to a smaller extent by increased lipid ordering in the immediate vicinity of the peptide. Under negative mismatch, alleviation takes place by a combination of local bilayer bending and the snorkeling of the lysine residues of the peptide. Simulations performed at a higher peptide/lipid molar ratio (1:25) reveal slower dynamics of both the peptide and lipid relative to those at a lower peptide/lipid ratio (1:128). The lysine residues have favorable interactions with specific oxygen atoms of the phospholipid headgroups, indicating the preferred localization of these residues at the lipid/water interface.},

abstract = {We introduce here a novel Monte Carlo simulation method for studying the interactions of hydrophobic peptides with lipid membranes. Each of the peptide's amino acids is represented as two interaction sites: one corresponding to the backbone alpha-carbon and the other to the side chain, with the membrane represented as a hydrophobic profile. Peptide conformations and locations in the membrane and changes in the membrane width are sampled using the Metropolis criterion, taking into account the underlying energetics. Using this method we investigate the interactions between the hydrophobic peptide M2delta and a model membrane. The simulations show that starting from an extended conformation in the aqueous phase, the peptide first adsorbs onto the membrane surface, while acquiring an ordered helical structure. This is followed by formation of a helical-hairpin and insertion into the membrane. The observed path is in agreement with contemporary understanding of peptide insertion into biological membranes. Two stable orientations of membrane-associated M2delta were obtained: transmembrane (TM) and surface, and the value of the water-to-membrane transfer free energy of each of them is in agreement with calculations and measurements on similar cases. M2delta is most stable in the TM orientation, where it assumes a helical conformation with a tilt of 14 degrees between the helix principal axis and the membrane normal. The peptide conformation agrees well with the experimental data; average root-mean-square deviations of 2.1 A compared to nuclear magnetic resonance structures obtained in detergent micelles and supported lipid bilayers. The average orientation of the peptide in the membrane in the most stable configurations reported here, and in particular the value of the tilt angle, are in excellent agreement with the ones calculated using the continuum-solvent model and the ones observed in the nuclear magnetic resonance studies. This suggests that the method may be used to predict the three-dimensional structure of TM peptides.},

abstract = {The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is a key aggregate species in Alzheimer's disease. Although important aspects of Abeta peptide aggregation are understood, the initial stage of aggregation from monomer to oligomer is still not clear. One potential mediator of this early aggregation process is interactions of Abeta with anionic cell membranes. We used unconstrained and umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations to investigate interactions between the 42-amino acid Abeta peptide and model bilayers of zwitterionic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipids and anionic dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) lipids. Using these methods, we determined that Abeta is attracted to the surface of DPPC and DOPS bilayers over the small length scales used in these simulations. We also found supporting evidence that the charge on both the bilayer surface and the peptide affects the free energy of binding of the peptide to the bilayer surface and the distribution of the peptide on the bilayer surface. Our work demonstrates that interactions between the Abeta peptide and lipid bilayer promotes a peptide distribution on the bilayer surface that is prone to peptide-peptide interactions, which can influence the propensity of Abeta to aggregate into higher-order structures.},

abstract = {The effect of salt on the binding of the antimicrobial peptide magainin to POPC lipid bilayers is studied by 40-50 ns molecular dynamics simulations of a POPC bilayer in the presence of different concentrations of Na+ and Cl- ions, corresponding to effective concentrations of 0, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 millimolar NaCl, with and without a single molecule of antimicrobial peptide magainin. Simulations without magainin showed that increasing salt concentration leads to the decrease in the area per lipid, a decrease in the head group tilt of the lipids, as well as increased order of lipid tails, in agreement with other recent simulations. Simulations with magainin show that peptide binding to the lipids is stronger at lower concentrations of salt. The peptides disorder the lipids in their immediate vicinity, but this effect is diminished as the salt concentration increases. Our studies indicate that while 50 ns simulations give information on peptide hydrogen bonding and lipid tail ordering that is insensitive to the initial peptide orientation, this run time is not sufficient to equilibrate the peptide position and orientation within the bilayer.},

With such detailed insight, engineering new sequences that are active but non-toxic can, in principle, be rationalized. Armed with supercomputers and accurate force fields for biomolecular interactions, we can now investigate phenomena that span hundreds of nanoseconds. Although the phenomena involved in antimicrobial activity, (i.e., diffusion of peptides, interaction with lipid layers, secondary structure attainment, possible surface aggregation, possible formation of pores, and destruction of the lipid layer integrity) collectively span time scales still prohibitively long for classical mechanics simulations, it is now feasible to investigate the initial approach of single peptides and their interaction with membrane mimics. In this article, we discuss the promise and the challenges of widely used models and detail our recent work on peptide-micelle simulations as an attractive alternative to peptide-bilayer simulations. We detail our results with two large structural classes of peptides, helical and beta-sheet and demonstrate how simulations can assist in engineering of novel antimicrobials with therapeutic potential.},

abstract = {Cationic antibacterial peptides are produced in all living organisms and possess either selective activity toward a certain type of cell or microorganism, or a broad spectrum of activity toward several types of cells including prokaryotic and mammalian cells. In order to exert their activity, peptides first interact with and traverse an outer barrier, e.g., mainly LPS and peptidoglycan in bacteria or a glycocalix layer and matrix proteins in mammalian cells. Only then, can the peptides bind and insert into the cytoplasmic membrane. The mode of action of many antibacterial peptides is believed to be the disruption of the lipidic plasma membrane. Therefore, model phospholipid membranes have been used to study the mode of action of antimicrobial peptides. These studies have demonstrated that peptides that act preferentially on bacteria are also able to interact with and permeate efficiently anionic phospholipids, whereas peptides that lyse mammalian cells bind and permeate efficiently both acidic and zwitterionic phospholipids membranes, mimicking the plasma membranes of these cells. It is now becoming increasingly clear that selective activity of these peptides against different cells depends also on other parameters that characterize both the peptide and the target cell. With respect to the peptide's properties, these include the volume of the molecule, its structure, and its oligomeric state in solution and in membranes. Regarding the target membrane, these include the structure, length, and complexity of the hydrophilic polysaccharide found in its outer layer. These parameters affect the ability of the peptides to diffuse through the cell's outer barrier and to reach its cytoplasmic plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Membrane-binding peripheral proteins play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane trafficking. Unlike integral membrane proteins, these proteins bind the membrane mostly in a reversible manner. Since peripheral proteins do not have canonical transmembrane segments, it is difficult to identify them from their amino acid sequences. As a first step toward genome-scale identification of membrane-binding peripheral proteins, we built a kernel-based machine learning protocol. Key features of known membrane-binding proteins, including electrostatic properties and amino acid composition, were calculated from their amino acid sequences and tertiary structures, which were then incorporated into the support vector machine to perform the classification. A data set of 40 membrane-binding proteins and 230 non-membrane-binding proteins was used to construct and validate the protocol. Cross-validation and holdout evaluation of the protocol showed that the accuracy of the prediction reached up to 93.7{\%} and 91.6{\%}, respectively. The protocol was applied to the prediction of membrane-binding properties of four C2 domains from novel protein kinases C. Although these C2 domains have 50{\%} sequence identity, only one of them was predicted to bind the membrane, which was verified experimentally with surface plasmon resonance analysis. These results suggest that our protocol can be used for predicting membrane-binding properties of a wide variety of modular domains and may be further extended to genome-scale identification of membrane-binding peripheral proteins.},

Using molecular dynamics simulations, the structural properties of these four peptides have been examined in solution as well as in a variety of membrane environments. It is shown that each of the peptides has a strong preference for binding to regions of high membrane curvature and that the structure of the peptides is dependent on the degree of local curvature. This suggests that the shorter peptides aurein 1.2 and citropin 1.1 act via a detergent-like mechanism because they can induce high local, but not long-range curvature, whereas the longer peptides maculatin 1.1 and caerin 1.1 require longer range curvature to fold and thus bind to and stabilize transmembrane pores.},

abstract = {Amphipathic peptides are accommodated within the diffuse gradient of polarity that characterizes the interfacial regions of phospholipid bilayer membranes. Interfacial membrane interactions are key to the diverse biological functions and activities of these peptides, which encompass a large class of antimicrobial peptides, including the helical peptides magainin, melittin, and RTA3 derived from the commensal bacterium Streptococcus mitis. For these peptides in vitro efficacy (high antimicrobial activity with minimal mammalian cell toxicity, equivalent to high potential therapeutic index; PTI), can be broadly understood in relation to the thermodynamics of interfacial binding and membrane disruption in membranes having surface charges that correspond to bacterial and mammalian cell membranes, respectively. Peptides with disrupted amphipathicity resulting from a positively charged amino acid residue on the non-polar helix face, can have greatly enhanced PTI, although a balance of amphipathicity, hydrophobicity and positive charge is required for retention of high antimicrobial activity. These observations are illustrated with recent examples from the literature, and studies on RTA3 and magainin analogues from our laboratories. Despite the identification and optimisation of peptides with very good PTI, a focus on addressing toxicity upon systemic administration and poor in vivo efficacy is likely to be required to translate growing understanding of the relationships between peptide interfacial activity and effects on cells, into novel systemic therapeutics.},

abstract = {There is widespread acceptance that cationic antimicrobial peptides, apart from their membrane-permeabilizing/disrupting properties, also operate through interactions with intracellular targets, or disruption of key cellular processes. Examples of intracellular activity include inhibition of DNA and protein synthesis, inhibition of chaperone-assisted protein folding and enzymatic activity, and inhibition of cytoplasmic membrane septum formation and cell wall synthesis. The purpose of this minireview is to question some widely held views about intracellular-targeting antimicrobial peptides. In particular, I focus on the relative contributions of intracellular targeting and membrane disruption to the overall killing strategy of antimicrobial peptides, as well as on mechanisms whereby some peptides are able to translocate spontaneously across the plasma membrane. Currently, there are no more than three peptides that have been convincingly demonstrated to enter microbial cells without the involvement of stereospecific interactions with a receptor/docking molecule and, once in the cell, to interfere with cellular functions. From the limited data currently available, it seems unlikely that this property, which is isolated in particular peptide families, is also shared by the hundreds of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides that differ in length, amino acid composition, sequence, hydrophobicity, amphipathicity, and membrane-bound conformation. Microbial cell entry and/or membrane damage associated with membrane phase/transient pore or long-lived transitions could be a feature common to intracellular-targeting antimicrobial peptides and mammalian cell-penetrating peptides that have an overrepresentation of one or two amino acids, i.e. Trp and Pro, His, or Arg. Differences in membrane lipid composition, as well as differential lipid recruitment by peptides, may provide a basis for microbial cell killing on one hand, and mammalian cell passage on the other.},

abstract = {Scoring functions are widely applied to the evaluation of protein-ligand binding in structure-based drug design. We have conducted a comparative assessment of 16 popular scoring functions implemented in main-stream commercial software or released by academic research groups. A set of 195 diverse protein-ligand complexes with high-resolution crystal structures and reliable binding constants were selected through a systematic nonredundant sampling of the PDBbind database and used as the primary test set in our study. All scoring functions were evaluated in three aspects, that is, "docking power", "ranking power", and "scoring power", and all evaluations were independent from the context of molecular docking or virtual screening. As for "docking power", six scoring functions, including GOLD::ASP, DS::PLP1, DrugScore(PDB), GlideScore-SP, DS::LigScore, and GOLD::ChemScore, achieved success rates over 70{\%} when the acceptance cutoff was root-mean-square deviation {\textless} 2.0 A. Combining these scoring functions into consensus scoring schemes improved the success rates to 80{\%} or even higher. As for "ranking power" and "scoring power", the top four scoring functions on the primary test set were X-Score, DrugScore(CSD), DS::PLP, and SYBYL::ChemScore. They were able to correctly rank the protein-ligand complexes containing the same type of protein with success rates around 50{\%}. Correlation coefficients between the experimental binding constants and the binding scores computed by these scoring functions ranged from 0.545 to 0.644. Besides the primary test set, each scoring function was also tested on four additional test sets, each consisting of a certain number of protein-ligand complexes containing one particular type of protein. Our study serves as an updated benchmark for evaluating the general performance of today's scoring functions. Our results indicate that no single scoring function consistently outperforms others in all three aspects. Thus, it is important in practice to choose the appropriate scoring functions for different purposes.},

abstract = {An assessment of nine scoring functions commonly applied in docking using a set of 189 protein-ligand complexes is presented. The scoring functions include the CHARMm potential, the scoring function DrugScore, the scoring function used in AutoDock, the three scoring functions implemented in DOCK, as well as three scoring functions implemented in the CScore module in SYBYL (PMF, Gold, ChemScore). We evaluated the abilities of these scoring functions to recognize near-native configurations among a set of decoys and to rank binding affinities. Binding site decoys were generated by molecular dynamics with restraints. To investigate whether the scoring functions can also be applied for binding site detection, decoys on the protein surface were generated. The influence of the assignment of protonation states was probed by either assigning "standard" protonation states to binding site residues or adjusting protonation states according to experimental evidence. The role of solvation models in conjunction with CHARMm was explored in detail. These include a distance-dependent dielectric function, a generalized Born model, and the Poisson equation. We evaluated the effect of using a rigid receptor on the outcome of docking by generating all-pairs decoys ("cross-decoys") for six trypsin and seven HIV-1 protease complexes. The scoring functions perform well to discriminate near-native from misdocked conformations, with CHARMm, DOCK-energy, DrugScore, ChemScore, and AutoDock yielding recognition rates of around 80{\%}. Significant degradation in performance is observed in going from decoy to cross-decoy recognition for CHARMm in the case of HIV-1 protease, whereas DrugScore and ChemScore, as well as CHARMm in the case of trypsin, show only small deterioration. In contrast, the prediction of binding affinities remains problematic for all of the scoring functions. ChemScore gives the highest correlation value with R(2) = 0.51 for the set of 189 complexes and R(2) = 0.43 for the set of 116 complexes that does not contain any of the complexes used to calibrate this scoring function. Neither a more accurate treatment of solvation nor a more sophisticated charge model for zinc improves the quality of the results. Improved modeling of the protonation states, however, leads to a better prediction of binding affinities in the case of the generalized Born and the Poisson continuum models used in conjunction with the CHARMm force field.},

abstract = {Treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections with antimicrobial agents can cause release of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the potent initiator of sepsis, which is the major cause of mortality in intensive care units worldwide. Structural information on peptides bound to LPS can lead to the development of more effective endotoxin neutralizers. Short linear antimicrobial and endotoxin-neutralizing peptide LF11, based on the human lactoferrin, binds to LPS, inducing a peptide fold with a "T-shaped" arrangement of a hydrophobic core and two clusters of basic residues that match the distance between the two phosphate groups of LPS. Side chain arrangement of LF11 bound to LPS extends the previously proposed LPS binding pattern, emphasizing the importance of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in a defined geometric arrangement. In anionic micelles, the LF11 forms amphipathic conformation with a smaller hydrophobic core than in LPS, whereas in zwitterionic micelles, the structure is even less defined. Protection of tryptophan fluorescence quenching in the order SDS{\textgreater}LPS{\textgreater}DPC and hydrogen exchange protection indicates the decreasing extent of insertion of the N terminus and potential role of peptide plasticity in differentiation between bacterial and eukaryotic membranes.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistant bacterial strains represent a global health problem with a strong social and economic impact. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. There is currently an extensive effort to understand the mode of action of antimicrobial peptides which are considered as one alternative to classical antibiotics. The main advantage of this class of substances, when considering bacterial resistance, is that they rapidly, within minutes, kill bacteria. Antimicrobial peptides can be found in every organism and display a wide spectrum of activity. Hence, the goal is to engineer peptides with an improved therapeutic index, i.e. high efficacy and target specificity. For the rational design of such novel antibiotics it is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanism of action. Biophysical studies have been performed using to a large extent membrane model systems demonstrating that there are distinctive different mechanisms of bacterial killing by antimicrobial peptides. One can distinguish between peptides that permeabilize and/or disrupt the bacterial cell membrane and peptides that translocate through the cell membrane and interact with a cytosolic target. Lantibiotics exhibit specific mechanisms, e.g. binding to lipid II, a precursor of the peptidoglycan layer, either resulting in membrane rupture by pore formation or preventing cell wall biosynthesis. The classical models of membrane perturbation, pore formation and carpet mechanism, are discussed and related to other mechanisms that may lead to membrane dysfunction such as formation of lipid-peptide domains or membrane disruption by formation of non-lamellar phases. Emphasis is on the role of membrane lipid composition in these processes and in the translocation of antimicrobial peptides.},

abstract = {Extensive use of classical antibiotics has led to the growing emergence of many resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria. Evidence has suggested that cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are of greatest potential to represent a new class of antibiotics. The largest group of AMPs comprises peptides that fold into an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation when interacting with the target microorganism. In the current study, a series of cationic AMPs of 20 amino acids was designed and synthesised based on four structural parameters, including charge, polar angle, hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment. The effect of these parameters on antimicrobial activity and selectivity was assessed by structural and biological analyses. Our results indicated that high hydrophobicity and amphipathicity (hydrophobic moment) were correlated with increased haemolytic activity, whilst antimicrobial activity was found to be less dependent on these factors. Three of the synthetic AMPs (GW-Q4, GW-Q6 and GW-H1) showed higher antimicrobial activity and selectivity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria compared with the naturally occurring AMPs magainin 2a and pleurocidin. This study also demonstrates that these rationally designed cationic and amphipathic helical AMPs exhibited high selectivity against several Vibrio spp. and are potential agents for future use in the treatment of these marine pathogens.},

The peptide analogs were also studied by temperature profiling in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, from 5 to 80 degrees C, to evaluate the self-associating ability of the molecules in solution, another important parameter in understanding peptide antimicrobial and hemolytic activities. A higher ability to self-associate in solution was correlated with weaker antimicrobial activity and stronger hemolytic activity of the peptides. Biological studies showed that strong hemolytic activity of the peptides generally correlated with high hydrophobicity, high amphipathicity, and high helicity. In most cases, the D-amino acid substituted peptides possessed an enhanced average antimicrobial activity compared with L-diastereomers. The therapeutic index of V681 was improved 90- and 23-fold against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. By simply replacing the central hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid residue on the nonpolar or the polar face of these amphipathic derivatives of V681 with a series of selected D-/L-amino acids, we demonstrated that this method has excellent potential for the rational design of antimicrobial peptides with enhanced activities.},

abstract = {Drosocin, pyrrhocoricin, and apidaecin, representing the short (18-20 amino acid residues) proline-rich antibacterial peptide family, originally isolated from insects, were shown to act on a target bacterial protein in a stereospecific manner. Native pyrrhocoricin and one of its analogues designed for this purpose protect mice from bacterial challenge and, therefore, may represent alternatives to existing antimicrobial drugs. Furthermore, this mode of action can be a basis for the design of a completely novel set of antibacterial compounds, peptidic or peptidomimetic, if the interacting bacterial biopolymers are known. Recently, apidaecin was shown to enter Escherichia coli and subsequently kill bacteria through sequential interactions with diverse target macromolecules. In this paper report, we used biotin- and fluorescein-labeled pyrrhocoricin, drosocin, and apidaecin analogues to identify biopolymers that bind to these peptides and are potentially involved in the above-mentioned multistep killing process. Through use of a biotin-labeled pyrrhocoricin analogue, we isolated two interacting proteins from E. coli. According to mass spectrometry, Western blot, and fluorescence polarization, the short, proline-rich peptides bound to DnaK, the 70-kDa bacterial heat shock protein, both in solution and on the solid-phase. GroEL, the 60-kDa chaperonin, also bound in solution. Control experiments with an unrelated labeled peptide showed that while binding to DnaK was specific for the antibacterial peptides, binding to GroEL was not specific for these insect sequences. The killing of bacteria and DnaK binding are related events, as an inactive pyrrhocoricin analogue made of all-D-amino acids failed to bind. The pharmaceutical potential of the insect antibacterial peptides is underscored by the fact that pyrrhocoricin did not bind to Hsp70, the human equivalent of DnaK. Competition assay with unlabeled pyrrhocoricin indicated differences in GroEL and DnaK binding and a probable two-site interaction with DnaK. In addition, all three antibacterial peptides strongly interacted with two bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations in solution, indicating that the initial step of the bacterial killing cascade proceeds through LPS-mediated cell entry.},
